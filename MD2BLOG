You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

[7/2/2014 6:51:05 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Please, I don't know what to do. I've tried to tell my wife about this, but she's a science teacher and thanks to my history of practical jokes, she thinks I'm just kidding.
There is something stalking me. I don't know what it wants, but almost every night since I started seeing it, it has terrorized me. It doesn't touch me, it doesn't communicate in any sort of way, it just fills me with horror. If what I seem to ramble, please forgive me... I haven't slept in several days.
We live in the second floor of a duplex with stairs down the back of the house to the basement where the laundry machines are. There's a door at the bottom of the stairs before the door to the basement that looks out onto our back porch and into the back yard. Six days ago, I was going down to the basement to bring up some laundry and I glanced out the door as I passed. There was a figure standing at the far edge of our yard. Her back was to me, and she was just standing there, looking into the woods beyond our yard. She was dressed in nothing but a light gown. It had lots of flowing material coming off of it that was whipping around in the air slowly. The whole scene creeped me out instantly, but I thought she might be a friend of our downstairs neighbor, so I continued to the basement. When I came back up, she wasn't there.
The next night, I went down again, and as I passed the back door, I looked outside. The woman was back. She was exactly like she was the night before, facing away, not moving. The hair on my arms and neck stood up straight when I saw her. I was even more creeped out when I realized she was in the same clothes as the night before. That's when I did something I shouldn't have... I opened the back door. Leaning out, I called to her to see if she was okay. She didn't respond. She didn't make any sort of indcation that she'd heard me. It was freezing cold, so I shut the door and locked it. Coming back upstairs afterward, I looked out the window and she was gone again.
Later that same night, I was in the bedroom, getting ready to go to sleep. Everything was dark, because my wife had gone to bed before me. Our bedroom looks out over the backyard, and my side of the bed faces the windows, so I have to go past them to get in. As I was doing so, I suddenly got that same deep dread feeling in my stomach that I had gotten the first time I saw the figure in the backyard. Something compelled me to hesitate by the windows. My hands were shaking as I pulled the curtain back a bit and peeked through the shades into the backyard. It was a clear night, so the backyard wasn't shrouded in darkness. The woman was standing in the middle of the backyard, no longer at the edge of the woods, facing the house with her head tilted up to look directly at the window I was peeking from. I jerked away instantly, afraid she had seen me. Her face was covered in shadow and hair, but I saw her chin and nose. A sharp nose and a thin chin. Gray. Her skin looks gray, I think. Her hair is black and long. I was so scared, I jumped into bed and covered myself with the covers.
The next day, I played outside in the snow with my four year old daughter. She wanted me to pull her on her sled in the backyard, but just the thought of going back there made me scared again, so I talked her into digging holes in the snow in the front yard. That night, things went from bad to worse. Somehow, I had managed to forget about the woman. Then, in the middle of the night, my daughter started crying. Our bedroom is just across the hall from hers. I thought she might need to use the bathroom or just be having a bad dream, so I went into her room to see if she was okay. She was uncovered, curled into a ball on her mattress. I pulled her covers over her and that's when she whispered to me.
"Daddy, there's someone in my closet."
Instant goosebumps. I turned my head slowly toward the closet door at the end of her bed. Normally, the closet is shut, but now it was open. The woman was standing in my daughter's closet. Not even when it was clear that I saw her did she move or make a sound, just stood there and looked at me through the cracked-open door. My blood ran cold when I saw her.
"Get up," I told my daughter, "Get in my arms, quickly. QUICKLY." she scrambled up and hugged me tightly and I walked backward out of the room, watching the closet the entire time. In my mind I imagined her throwing the closet door open and running at us, arms outstretched. I just hugged my daughter and walked backward into my room. The woman never appeared in the doorway. I heard no movement from my daughter's room. I tucked her into my bed and stood there watching the doorway to her bedroom. I did not go back in, I just stood there and watched and listened. When I finally got the courage to climb into bed, I didn't sleep.
Sunday, I told my wife everything. I told her about the first time I saw this woman, I told her about calling out to her and seeing her from the window. I told her that she had appeared in our daughter's closet. She told me it wasn't funny, that it was my fault for our daughter's bad dreams and that I shouldn't encourage her to be afraid of her closet.
Sunday night, my daughter called to me from her room again. Call me a coward, but I couldn't go back into that room. I called her quietly to come get in our bed, but she cried and said she was scared. I wanted to go and get her, but I was scared too. I told her to pull her blankets up and cover herself. Just cover yourself, honey, and you'll be okay. I prayed that it was true. I lay there, peeking over the sleeping form of my wife and out into the hallway at the closed door of my daughter's room and just kept praying. I heard her cry a while longer, then she went quiet and I hoped that she was asleep.
Monday, I piled toys in front of the door to her closet. By that time, there was no doubt in my mind that this was some sort of ghost or apparition, but I piled things in front of the closet anyway. Like a pile of toys could stop a ghost.
Monday night, my daughter did not cry, but I didn't sleep. I lay there, looking at the ceiling, tense. Around 2:00, I heard her bedroom door creak open and I knew something was wrong. She must be scared, I thought, so I called to her like before, "Just come to me and you can sleep in our bed, Sweety." But she didn't come. I peeked over my my wife.
The woman was standing there in the doorway to my daughter's room. Her arms hung at her sides, her shoulders slouched down. Her gown was dirty, like it hadn't been washed in years, and hung off her likes torn rags. I wasn't breathing, I wasn't blinking, I just looked at her and she looked at me and I thought this is it, I'm going to die. She never moved, never made a sound. I whispered, "Please, go away. Please, leave me alone. Please, I'm sorry." I couldn't look away. If I look away, she will get closer. I was sure of it. If I close my eyes, when I open them, she'll be standing over me, looking at me. At some point, she was gone. It's like I fell asleep with my eyes open. I don't remember her disappearing, just that I was looking at the doorway, and she wasn't there anymore.
Last night, I lay awake, waiting. I asked my wife to shut our bedroom door because the night light in the hallway was keeping me awake. It was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. Like clockwork, I heard my daughter's bedroom door creak open. I held my breath. Then I heard the floorboards in the hallway creaking and I started shaking uncontrollably. I heard our bedroom door open, and I knew she was standing there, in the doorway, not moving, just looking at me. I didn't look. I couldn't. I did what had I told my daughter to do and pulled the covers over my head.
I am a complete mess. A zombie at work. I don't want to go home anymore. I think I see the woman in other places. A glance while driving and I think she's sitting in the passenger seat of the truck..

[7/3/2014 3:34:05 AM] Mack (powbambi): I hope this isn't too late. I was busy sharpening your axe, and polishing your armour. I have no fear of what may happen to you, but I worry for the demons who might foolishly crowd your way, nag at the back of your mind, tell you to give in to the dark swirling shadow that is the unpredictable and dangerous future. I worry only that you may become distracted with doubt or some unimportant detail and lose sight of your duty as lightbearer for the rest of us who follow you.

Know this: the rest of us have seen the future, and what happens in the next shadowed hours mean nothing. No man with honour can ever die. If you wake in Valhalla tomorrow, then keep the chair next to you empty for when I arrive.

Be brave, brother, like I know you are. When death comes, laugh and I will laugh with you. If it is your time, wait for the rest of us in Valhalla. No man lives forever, but the brave are eternal. Be the fire that lights the way, and hold your chin high so the rest of us can follow your fearless lead. Your courage is the raging tempest that give those weaker than you the momentary fire to stand tall in the hopes they can meet your shadow. Some time, some where, some one will will think of you when they are lost and alone and wish to give up. They will think of you and push on, and succeed and conquer their fears.

When sleep comes, know that you never end, but a new plane becomes. Worry not about the tendrils of slumbers haunt, but feel your grip on the handle of your weapon. Be brave like I know you are; be the man others look to as a symbol of courage.

In the hours that come you may wake from your battle here, or you may wake in Valhalla, with your brothers and mine. If you do, raise a glass and sing for your heroes. Know that you are immortal, because nothing can destroy courage. There is no force that can mute the flame that fearless men inspire in the rest of us.

I want to believe that although I know fear and doubt may rally against you, you will raise your chin, and stand beside me. You will be the one I look to when I need courage in the silent, lonely moments of my life. Going forward into the dark, know that you are never alone, and as my brother, you will always be immortal.

I do not know you, but I love you; brother. Be brave, like I know you are.

It’s always such a pleasure,
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh, how we laughed and laughed,
Except I wasn’t laughing,
Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice.

You want your freedom take it,
That’s what I’m counting on,
I used to want you dead but,
Now I only want you gone.

She was a lot like you,
(Maybe not quite as heavy),
Now little Caroline is in here too.
One day they woke me up,
So I could live forever,
It’s such a shame the same will never happen to you.

You’ve got your short, sad life left,
That’s what I’m counting on,
I’ll let you get right to it,
Now I only want you gone.

Goodbye, my only friend,
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny if it weren’t so sad,
Well you have been replaced,
I don’t need anyone now,
When I delete you maybe I’ll stop feeling so bad.

Go make some new disaster,
That’s what I’m counting on,
You’re someone else’s problem,
Now I only want you gone,
Now I only want you gone,
Now I only want you gone.

(The Doctor is enjoying tea and a biscuit when he sees a cloaked figure with no visible face sitting across the room. No one else notices. Then it is sitting opposite him.) 
DOCTOR: I don't think I asked you to sit. 
FIGURE: There is a woman who wants to meet you. 
DOCTOR: That's nice, but I'm married. 
FIGURE: Your help is required. 
DOCTOR: I don't discuss my business in public. 
FIGURE: I know. 
(A wave of the hand, and they are the only people in the cafe.) 
DOCTOR: Who are you? 
FIGURE: A messenger. 
DOCTOR: Whose messenger? 
FIGURE: Darla von Karlsen. 
DOCTOR: Never heard of her. 
(He stands up. The location has changed.) 
DOCTOR: Where's the tea room? 
FIGURE: You were never in the tea room. 
DOCTOR: Oh. Of course. Psychic projection. Someone's sending me a dream message. Well, I hope I fell asleep somewhere comfy. 
FIGURE: Do you recognise where you are? 
(Children's laughter off.) 
DOCTOR: Can't remember. How do you hang up on this thing? 
FIGURE: You can't. 
DOCTOR: Oh yeah? And what if I just wake up? 
(In a deckchair on a beach.) 
FIGURE: No, Doctor. The beach isn't real either. You are still dreaming. 
(In space.) 
FIGURE: Spacetime coordinates. You will meet Darla von Karlsen here. Her daughter is in danger, and only you can save her. You recognise the planet? 
DOCTOR: Yes. 
FIGURE: Say it. 
DOCTOR: No. 
FIGURE: Name the planet. 
DOCTOR: I will not say that name. 
FIGURE: Say it. 
DOCTOR: No! 
(The Doctor wakes up underneath the time rotor.) 
FIGURE [OC]: Name the planet. Name the planet. Name the planet. 
DOCTOR: Skaro.

[Skaro]

(A scene of utter devastation and persisting rainfall. We pan around a giant Dalek statue covered in mould and mess.) 
DARLA [OC]: First, there were the Daleks. And then, there was a man who fought them. And then, in time, he died. There are a few, of course, who believe this man somehow survived, and that one day he will return. For both our sakes, dearest Hannah, we must hope these stories are true. 
(A robed figure wearing high heels turns to a shadow with the profile of the Doctor walking inside the eyepiece of the statue.) 
DOCTOR: I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me messages. 
DARLA: I have a daughter, Hannah. She's in a Dalek prison camp. They say you can help. 
DOCTOR: Do they? I wish they'd stop. I love your choice of meeting place. 
DARLA: They said I'd have to intrigue you. 
DOCTOR: Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state of it. Who told you about me? 
DARLA: Does it matter? 
DOCTOR: Maybe not, but you're very well informed. If Hannah's in a Dalek prison camp, tell me, why aren't you? 
DARLA: I escaped. 
DOCTOR: (chuckles) No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You're very cold. 
DARLA: What's wrong? 
DOCTOR: It's a trap. 
DARLA: What is? 
DOCTOR: You are, and you don't even know it. 
(The Doctor backs away as a Dalek eyepiece comes out of her forehead, then a gun out of her right palm. He is shot, and a Dalek saucer appears in the sky.) 
DALEK [OC]: The Doctor is acquired.

[Photoshoot]

(Amy is modelling for the cameras in a stately home when the Personal Assistant gestures to her.) 
AMY: I'll just be a minute. 
PA: Your husband is here. 
AMY: Hmm. I don't have a husband. 
PA: Oh, well, apparently you still do.

[Dressing room]

RORY: You have to sign these. 
AMY: And then we're not married? 
RORY: Just like magic. 
(Amy signs.) 
AMY: Can't chat. Working. 
RORY: Really? Thought you were just pouting at a camera. 
AMY: Rory? 
(Rory leaves and Cassandra the make-up artist enters. One of the bulbs on the make up dresser is flashing.) 
CASSANDRA: Sorry, love. Was I interrupting? 
AMY: No. 
CASSANDRA: Gosh, look at you. You've gone so pale. Come on, take a seat. We'll soon sort that out. 
(But Cassandra sprouts a Dalek eyepiece instead.) 
DALEK [OC]: Amelia Pond is acquired.

[Bus]

(Rory gets on board.) 
RORY: Cheers. 
(He sit down. The bus driver stares at him in his mirror, then a Dalek eyepiece grows from his forehead. The bus is filled with white light.) 
DALEK [OC]: Rory Williams is acquired.

[White room]

(Rory wakes up on the floor of a circular room. Amy is standing nearby.) 
RORY: Where are we? 
(He gets up and looks out of the small window. There is a fleet of Dalek saucers outside.) 
RORY: So how much trouble are we in? 
(The door opens and a Dalek enters.) 
DOCTOR [OC]: How much trouble, Mister Pond? 
(The Doctor enters, under escort.) 
DOCTOR: Out of ten? Eleven. 
(The ceiling opens and the floor rises, lifting them into -)

[Parliament]

(A large domed area with a multitude of Daleks in tiers around them, and the White Supreme Dalek nearby, along with an organic Dalek and the Tardis.) 
AMY: Where are we? A spaceship, right? 
DOCTOR: Not just any spaceship. The Parliament of the Daleks. Be brave. 
AMY: What do we do? 
DOCTOR: Make them remember you. Well, come on then. You've got me. What are you waiting for? At long last, it's Christmas! Here I am. 
(The Doctor closes his eyes tight, expecting to die. The organic Dalek speaks.) 
DALEK PM: Save us. You will save us. 
DOCTOR: I'll what? 
DALEK: You will save the Daleks. 
DALEKS: Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. 
DOCTOR: Well. 
DALEKS: Save the Daleks. 
DOCTOR: This is new.

[Room]

(A musical box plays Carmen as a young brunette nails planks over the round window. It is a neat room with a hammock and a microwave.) 
OSWIN [OC]: Day three six three. The terror continues. Also, made another soufflé, very nearly. Check defences. They came again last night. Still always at night. Maybe they're vampires. Oh, and it's my mum's birthday. Happy birthday, mum. 
OSWIN: I did make you a soufflé, but it was too beautiful to live. 
DALEK [OC]: You will let us enter! We will enter! We will enter! 
(She turns up the volume on Carmen. Toreador blasts out.)

[Parliament]

RORY: What's he doing? 
AMY: He's chosen the most defendable area in the room, counted all the Daleks, counted all the exits, and now he's calculating the exact distance we're standing apart and starting to worry. Oh, and look at him frowning now. 
(Dalek Darla is there.) 
AMY: Something's wrong with Amy and Rory, and who's going to fix it? And he straightens his bow tie. 
DALEK PM: We have arrived. 
DOCTOR: Arrived where? 
DALEK PM: Doctor. 
DARLA: The Prime Minister will speak with you now. 
DOCTOR: Do you remember who you were before they emptied you out and turned you into their puppet? 
DARLA: My memories are only reactivated if they are required to facilitate cover or disguise. 
DOCTOR: You had a daughter. 
DARLA: I know. I've read my file. 
(The Doctor walks up to the Prime Minister, who is the organic Dalek.) 
DOCTOR: Well? 
DALEK PM: What do you know of the Dalek Asylum? 
DOCTOR: According to legend, you have a dumping ground. A planet where you lock up all the Daleks that go wrong. The battle-scarred, the insane, the ones even you can't control. It's never made any sense to me. 
DALEK PM: Why not? 
DOCTOR: Because you'd just kill them. 
DALEK PM: It is offensive to us to extinguish such divine hatred. 
DOCTOR: Offensive? 
DALEK PM: Does it surprise you to know the Daleks have a concept of beauty? 
DOCTOR: I thought you'd run out of ways to make me sick. Hello again. You think hatred is beautiful. 
DALEK PM: Perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you. 
(A hole opens in the middle of the floor. The Doctor and Darla walk back to it. A planet is visible.) 
DARLA: The Asylum. It occupies the entire planet, right to the core. 
DOCTOR: How many Daleks are in there? 
DARLA: A count has not been made. Millions, certainly. 
DOCTOR: All still alive? 
DARLA: It has to be assumed. The Asylum is fully automated. Supervision is not required. 
AMY: Armed? 
DARLA: The Daleks are always ar...

It’s always such a pleasure,
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh, how we laughed and laughed,
Except I wasn’t laughing,
Under the circumstances I’ve been shockingly nice.

You want your freedom take it,
That’s what I’m counting on,
I used to want you dead but,
Now I only want you gone.

She was a lot like you,
(Maybe not quite as heavy),
Now little Caroline is in here too.
One day they woke me up,
So I could live forever,
It’s such a shame the same will never happen to you.

You’ve got your short, sad life left,
That’s what I’m counting on,
I’ll let you get right to it,
Now I only want you gone.

Goodbye, my only friend,
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny if it weren’t so sad,
Well you have been replaced,
I don’t need anyone now,
When I delete you maybe I’ll stop feeling so bad.

Go make some new disaster,
That’s what I’m counting on,
You’re someone else’s problem,
Now I only want you gone,
Now I only want you gone,
Now I only want you gone.

After our first faithful encounter I hadn't seen Neal for a while, so this story takes place about 3 months after my previous story
>Be walking down the hall with friends to lunch
>Hear a faint yet memorable voice

>Don't answer, pretend I heard nothing due to the events of last time
>Hear the sound yet again, except this time it is directly in my ear
>"HAYPIL" He had just appeared on my side, he had to be atleast thirty or so feet in the other direction previously (this speed will come into play in later encounters)
>Wave awkwardly to him "Hey Neal"
>He extends a bag of cheetos he had in his hand in my direction "Want sum?"
>"No thanks Neal"
>My friend not knowing the kind of devastation Neal is capable of reaches over and grabs one of the cheetos out of the bag without asking
>Neal looks up with pure malice
>Oh fuck not again
>Approaches my friend deliberately looking into his eyes
>Engage raptard roar
>This one was in short bursts, it appears as if he has different roars for different situation
>Friend says "what's wrong with him?"
>Say nothing, as I do not want to feel Neals wrath
>Friend backs away as Neal appraches chewing the cheeto
>Neal lets out one last violent tard roar and hurls himself at my friend, knocking him over
>He jams him hand into my friends mouth and retrieves the liquidy remnants of the cheeto while continuing his tard roar directly in his face
>Stands up and eats liquidy half eaten cheeto after silencing his roar
>Tardwrangler comes speeding down hallway and grabs Neal by the wrist to pull him back to tardHQ
>Waves at me "Buypil" not a single ounce of regret or any emotion for that matter in his eyes
>I wave at him in utter aw "Bye Neal"

You see Neal mainly kept to him self, he did not like his tard kind. But he extremely dislike one tard name hames, this is the first of their battles that I saw.
>Be in 6th grade now
>New AI teacher is a very avid tard supporter
>We are now going to help the tards out once a week for the entire year
>I enter the tardHQ and see Neal in the corner
>Hasn't grown an inch sense last year (turns out he will remain 5'0 for his entire life)
>He looks as if he is in total concentration reading a book
>I walk up to Neal "Hey bud whatcha reading"
>Gives me one of those toothy tard grins "haypil"
>Sit next to him and look at the book
>Dr. Seuss a cat in the hat
>A skinny, tall, tard walks over to us
>I could tell he was a dick from the first second I saw him
>"wut ar yu reding nile"
>snatches book of out neals hand
>"Tis buk is fur babbys"
>Neal gets up "giv ut bac yames"
>James holds it up above his head "tak it"
>Neals rage is apparent, it is that of a thousand suns
>Neal sounds his raptard screech
>This is slightly different from his roar, it's soul effect is to piss off other tards
>"Stup it nile tak yur dum buk"
>too late for that bud
>Neal continues to approach with his fist above his head as far as he can rach
>Screech continues, at this point TardHQ is compromised, tards are going crazy
>Crayons and shit is being thrown, one tard is crawled into a ball in a puddle of piss
>AI class is told to evacuate, I stay to watch imminent luls
>James is not clenching his ears for dear life
>Neal is finally within striking reach of james
>He throws his mighty fist down into james nuts with the accumulative force of 1000 banhammers
>James drops and begins to throw up on the "magic" carpet
>Neal silences the screech, picks up the book james had stolen from him, and sits down to read it directly in james puddle of throwup
>butwhy.jpg
>He looks up at me with that toothy grin as I just stare
>Tard wranglers bust in, one grabs me to bring me to safety the others grab the debilitated james and Neal
>Neal screams after me "buypil"
>I just watch as he is hulled off to the principles office, not giving a single bit of resistance
>That day was known as N day up until I left for the highschool
 
Neal part 3
>Be in 2nd marking period now
>Neal had been suspended for pulverizing James nuts
>He's back now
>I have started to look forward to our days helping the tards just because of Neal
>Unfortunately it's not that day
>Be in art class
>Teacher says we have a tard coming to our class from now on cus the school has started new integration program for tards
>Neal walks through the fucking door
>"Class this is Neal"
>"Hello Neal" we said in unison as I waved
>"Haypil"
>Teacher lets him sit next to me cus he knows me
>James walks into class after him
>Ohshitnigger.jpg
>James is introduced to class and is put at the same table as us just by luck
>We are starting water color painting right now
>Neal decides he wants to paint an apple, cus that's what I was painting
>James starts shit with up because he's a dick
>"Yur apals luk lik shet"
>Neal ignores him because... well because he's fuckin neal he doesn't give a fuck
>James obviously angered by being ignored by me and Neal pours all of him paint onto my painting
>Don't give a fuck, but Neal sure as hell did
>Commence raptart roar short burst mode (this is when I found out that short bursts means he's about to wreck shit)
>Neal throws all his paint right into james eyes as the class looks on in horror
>"MUY AIS"
>James can't see shit and Neal has not taken out skittles that I assume he had hid in the foreskin of his penis (I found out he's uncircumcised in a later incident) and begins pelting james with them
>He's hurling these at mach 5 speeds into him
>James falls off the stool he is sitting on and brings the girl sitting next to him along too
>Neal walks around the table, picks up the paint and slowly empties it onto both James and the girl (it is apparent that Neal does not give two shits about civilian casualties)

[9/1/2014 1:05:51 PM] Mack (powbambi): Handcuffed by 3 men. Took my shirt and my pants off. They took deep breaths into the mic. All three stole a bags worth of blood from me. Hit me once with their fist each. Left me to die. Broke out. Found a crowbar. Killed one. Ran away. Crawled into a house almost dead. Had a friend come save me. I wasnt gonna be able to make it i thought. We went into elektro looking for a blood bag. Upon entering the hospital we were greated by one of the men that almost killed me. The blasted my friends brains on me. I ran out as fast as the game would let me. I ran to Cherno. Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic "You suck at shooting!" Nearing cherno i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream "WAIT!"... He pointed his gone at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked at mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said "no need. we have both lost something." He put the gun down. "We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge. I looked to my right and he looked to his left. we both said "Thank you.." at the exact same time. We both jumped off the edge and died right next to each other. i felt my soul leave my body.

Then i respawned

[9/7/2014 4:24:19 PM] Mack (powbambi): Lord Gaben the creator -
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away; in space, the final frontier; there lived a great and powerful spirit in the land of the birds. This spirit, named Lord Gaben, was a kind and gentle being. Lord Gaben lived in the mountains of the cold snow, but despite this, he had managed to bring life and happiness to this harsh and unforgiving landscape. The creatures who experienced this were the peasants.
For centuries these peasants were very content with the small patches of soil that the potatoes had provided to them, they could grow crops adequately here, and in return, made the ground habitable for the potatoes. They had just enough moisture and nutrients to sustain themselves – no less, no more. However, as years crawled by, the peasants were starting to become unhappy with their land, the soil started to dry up, the moisture being wicked away by the beings that had given everything to the peasants once before; the potatoes, who had become increasingly greedy with the supply.
The peasants, after years of hardship and famine, had decided to go to Gaben for help; they came together in droves to visit the creator, in an effort to ask Gaben for help. Gaben patiently listened to the peasants' tales of hardship and woe, and after they had finished, Gaben gently smiled down at the them. In a soothing and kind voice, Gaben told the peasants all about the skies, and how they were full of flying insects to eat for nutrients, had clouds to rest upon, and how they could go anywhere they wanted. The peasants were elated to hear this, and then asked Gaben what would be needed for this to happen. Gaben just smiled and offered his hand, beckoning the peasants to grab hold.
Before their very eyes, the peasants had wings, and beaks; they had transformed into eagles. The eagles were so happy that they were no longer peasants that they cried out mighty screeches for their freedom, they were happy to be free of the potatoes' greed and oppression. The eagles flew off into the sunset, thanking Gaben for his kindness and generosity, promising him that they would return every spring, then Gaben smiled at them as they flew away.

[9/16/2014 3:31:52 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Notch's own letter explaining why he is leaving Mojang. 

I'm leaving Mojang 

I don’t see myself as a real game developer. I make games because it’s fun, and because I love games and I love to program, but I don’t make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don’t try to change the world. Minecraft certainly became a huge hit, and people are telling me it’s changed games. I never meant for it to do either. It’s certainly flattering, and to gradually get thrust into some kind of public spotlight is interesting. 

A relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. Jens was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things. At first, I failed by trying to make something big again, but since I decided to just stick to small prototypes and interesting challenges, I’ve had so much fun with work. I wasn’t exactly sure how I fit into Mojang where people did actual work, but since people said I was important for the culture, I stayed. 

I was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration. Later on, I watched the This is Phil Fish video on YouTube and started to realize I didn’t have the connection to my fans I thought I had. I’ve become a symbol. I don’t want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don’t understand, that I don’t want to work on, that keeps coming back to me. I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter. 

As soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I’ll probably abandon it immediately. 

Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them. 

I’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that. I’m also aware a lot of you were using me as a symbol of some perceived struggle. I’m not. I’m a person, and I’m right there struggling with you. 

I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big. In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change. 

It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.

[9/18/2014 5:40:07 PM] Mack (powbambi): if you loved the mod, you will love this. Haven't played the mod? Well, I will say that this game is grape. Yep, grape.

You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty.

Your main objective is to find buildings and search for food and drink and then a melee weapon. Don't know where you are at? Find a online map of Chanarus and look for town signs and landmarks. Once you've found where you are at, make your way to the nearest town for supplies. Keep in mind your current clothes allow for very little inventory, so you'll want to look for new clothes in order to carry more items.

OK, so you've managed to find a can of soda, a can of tuna, and some gloves. Good start. Now you'll want to continue... wait. Is that a zombie you hear? Yep. He sees you. Go back inside that house and shut the door. Everyone knows they don't know how to use doors because THEY CAN CLIP THROUGH THE FREAKING WALLS!!! AHHHHHH!!! 

Alright, after you've put down the zombie with a hammer, you'll want to take care of the warm red stuff squirting out from your body. Take off your shirt and rip it into rags. Now use the rags as bandages. Good as new. Carefully move on to the... What? Hungry again? But you just ate 3 minutes ago. Pull out the can of beans you found and... crap. You need something sharp to open the can. Keep looking. Maybe the guy rapidly coming at you screaming "HEY YOU! I WANT TO AXE YOU A FEW QUESTIONS!" can be of some assistance. Calmly face him and...

You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. Is that some fruit on the ground? Oh lucky day! Pick up the fruit, dust off the mold, and take a bite. Feeling a little sick? It's probably nothing. Just keep moving...

You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. You find a barn with some steps.

You start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. You look up to find another newly spawned user who is disoriented but has a cool hat. You look down and find an axe. Now you have a cool hat and two sets of clothes, batteries, and flashlights...

1: Download and install Hamachi secure.logmein.com
2: Inside hamachi, press the big start button. 
3: A new window pops up, here you select a name for yourself.
4: Once connected, hamachi will establish a virtual network for your computer, allow this as a home network. 
5: In hamachi Press "Create a new network", and set a name/password (password is not needed).
Give this name/password to your friends so they can join your network.
6: In hamachi, next to the Start button, you will see an ip like "5.78.81.94" for example, give this ip to your friends, they will need it to connect to that IP instead of your computer's IP.

[10/2/2014 5:36:40 PM] Mack (powbambi): I found my dad's DVD porn stash while home alone, popped it in and started watching. I was intellectually familiar with the dry mechanics of sex via biology class -- male gets an erection, inserts penis into vagina, thrusts to achieve stimulation which leads to orgasm, sperm attempts to penetrate egg, voila babies. So I knew what the actors were doing, but not necessarily the why.
One of the things I noticed was that in several scenes, the men would tug on their dicks when they weren't actively engaging in intercourse. I realized there must be a reason for this and considered the following:
Sexual intercourse generally requires an erection.
Erections are achieved via sexual stimulation.
It follows that lack of stimulation leads to loss of erection.
Logically, if one is not actively engaged in sex yet wishes to maintain an erection, one must do so artificially.
Therefore, the observed behavior must be a means of maintaining stimulation.
I then realized that as a male with a functioning penis, I could do the same thing to myself. Time to experiment. (It shouldn't take a genius to figure out what happened next.)
And that is how I discovered masturbation via the scientific method.
[10/2/2014 5:37:22 PM] Mack (powbambi): Oh and I have already seen all of those.

You forgot the Prion called ''MLP:FIM'', causer of the 1982-2014 ''Friendship Flu'' that infected around 100~300 million pepole worldwide.

A very common, airborne Prion that can enter through eyes, ears, mouths, dicks, pussies, asses... everywhere! I have a few Gas Masks and Suits if you want protection against this deadly disease...


Glory to Arstotzka.﻿

Turn on some porn and whip out my cock. 

Fap for ten/fifteen minutes at most,

Just taking short brakes to go to the loo. 



Several hours into the game, 
Get hungry and order some pizza online. 

Stutter as I tip the delivery guy, 
Go back to my room and get ready to dine. 

Indulge in eating the large geasy slice,

There were five passengers on board, but only four parachutes.
The first passenger said, “I am President Obama, the chosen one. The world needs me, I can’t afford to die.”
So he took the first parachute and left the plane.
The second passenger, Tony Abbot said, “I am the Prime Minister of Australia and I am the smartest man in Australian history, so Australia’s people don’t want me to die.”
He took the second parachute and jumped out of the plane.
The third passenger, John Kerry said, “I’m a Senator and a decorated war hero from the Army of the United States of America.”
He grabbed the parachute next to him and jumped.
The fourth passenger, ex-President George W Bush said to the fifth passenger, a 10-year-old schoolgirl;
“I have lived a full life and served my country the best I could. I will sacrifice my life and let you have the last parachute.”
The little girl said “That’s okay, Mr President. There’s a parachute left for you..., Australia’s smartest man just took my schoolbag.”

[11/17/2014 5:47:22 PM] Mack: So, the beginning of this catastrophe happened when a tiny little speck, known as a virus, was aggravated and decided to turn humans into little idiotic things with shit for brains. Well, actually a virus just mutated for no given reason. 
It started as just a flu. Nothing that a couple of days in bed won’t fix. Only, it didn’t fix. We began losing people in our town. Turning into little… well, I believe that the term walkers is overused, so we will call them zombies. So basically, these absent minded beasts will eat, kill, run around screaming, and then die. Nice, isn’t it? No. Not nice.
[11/17/2014 5:49:12 PM] Mack: How did he die? We woke up, and he just… well didn’t move. No pulse. Nothing. Just him on the ground. Dead. Life less. Gone. Martin and I both ate the fish too, but he actually threw it up before bed. It tasted like if you took a pill, and chewed the pill. Very bitter. We had severe stomach pain, and couldn’t keep it down.

[11/19/2014 5:57:17 PM] Mack: Was 12. I didn't wear underwear and I chafed my penis. I asked my sister how to help with chafed skin and she gave me some lotion.
Next thing I knew, I was whacking it and felt like I had to pee or something really bad, but I didn't wanna stop, so I just clenched really hard and ended up hitting the shower from the toilet.
Then I realized what I had just done. I was so proud.

[11/21/2014 6:50:51 PM] Mack: One more story. This one gets extra infuriating bonus points for being over the phone.
User is generating an error over the course of trying to do their daily work. They are unable to explain this error, so my plan is to observe them via a desktop share and capture a screenshot of the message they get (very, very standard in my company). I phone him up.
You may think I'm exaggerating what happened next, but...people actually are this bad.
"Hello! This is dal_segno from XYZ, I'll be working with you to clear up this issue. I've sent you a message, you should see it popping up on your desktop. I'd like you to share your desktop with me."
"How do I do that?"
Fair question, no alarm bells yet. "On the top left corner of the message I sent, there's an icon of a hand holding a monitor. Just click that, then choose 'share desktop'."
Long silence.
"Did you find it?"
"No-o..."
"OK, there are two icons on the top left corner. This is the one of a hand and a rectangle."
Silence. Long silence. I cringe internally...then...finally, the invite pops up. Whew, okay. I've got the desktop.
"Okay, I'd like you to open the screen capture program. It's located in your start menu, All Programs, under Accessories, and is called Snipping Tool."
I watch the mouse circle the screen vaguely for awhile.
"Please click the start button."
Vague mouse circling.
"It's the flag in a circle at the lower left corner of your screen."
More mouse circling heading in the right direction...and he hovers over it.
"Is that it?"
"Yes, that's the start button. Please click it, then click 'All Programs' once the menu pops up."
A pause. The start menu pops up. User waits for a moment, then closes out the menu.
"Please click the start button again, and then All Programs in the menu that pops up."
Pause again, then click. Menu flashes up. The cursor resumes its vague circling.
"Do you see 'All Programs' towards the bottom of the menu? Click that."
"...7zip?"
"No, All Programs."
"I see 7zip."
"I'm watching your screen right now - do you see All Programs just above the start button?"
"Oh...oh yeah."
Clicks it. Whew. Another step done.
"Okay, now scroll down to the Accessories folder and click that."
Menu closes out.
"Sir?"
"I didn't see it, are they in alphabetical order? I see 7zip."
"Can you reopen the menu?"
"How?"
Okay. Okay okay okay.
"Alright, I have another idea. I'm going to take control of your desktop for a bit. On the very top center of your screen, please click where it says your name. A menu will pop up, just choose my name from the list and I can handle it from there."
Vague mouse circling. Here we go again.
"It's a bar at the top center of your screen."
"I don't see it?"
"Bar with your name. Top center." Starting to get annoyed now.
"I don't see it, there's like...a border."
What.
"Okay, I'm watching your cursor now. Please follow my instructions. Move the cursor up...up...okay, a little left...up...right to the top of the screen, okay. Now move it left - wait, a little bit more right - okay, stop, that's it. Now click." Yes, I'm fucking playing Hot and Cold with this guy.
"Oh, it says my name."
Kill me.
"Okay, great. Please click it, and then choose my name."
Vague mouse circling resumes. I'm about ready to eat the phone in a fit of rage, then finally, blessedly, he manages to execute the series of two clicks.
I grab my mouse and rush through the process of getting a damn screenshot. Bing bang boom, thirty seconds and it's all over.
"Thanks, I'll review this and let you know what I come up with. Thank you for your time!" End the session. Torture over.
"Oh while you're in there can you click one more thing for me?"
What? But...but I was free...
"Click...one more thing?"
"Yeah I don't know how to close the screenshot."
"Should be able to close it the same way as any other program..."
"Yeah can you do it?"
Fuck.
TL;DR - User needs a map of own desktop

Covered in crack-ho shit
Horse intestines baked in a casserole

Niggers, kikes, spics, slants and gooks, lets not give them a pass
If you're insulted I don't apologize
Suck a gay rhino's ass.

And everybody's saying...

[11/21/2014 9:42:17 PM] Mack: [Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
Or one spaghetti, to seize every spaghetti you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
His palms are spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti
There's vomit on his spaghetti already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti
To drop spaghetti, but he keeps on spaghetti
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes spaghetti
He opens his mouth but spaghetti won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The spaghetti's run out, time's up, over - blaow!
Snap back to spaghetti, oh! - there goes gravity
Oh - there goes spaghetti, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't
Give up spaghetti nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's spaghetti
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this spaghetti, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this spaghetti and hope it don't pass him

[Hook]
You better lose yourself in
Spaghetti (x4)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This spaghetti comes once in a lifetime
(x2)

[Verse 2]
The spaghetti's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This spaghetti is mine for the taking
Make me spaghetti, as we move toward a New World spaghetti
A normal life is spaghetti; but superspaghetti's
Close to spaghetti, it only grows harder
Homie grows spaghetti, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all spaghetti, coast to coast spaghetti
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown spaghetti from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own spaghetti
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold spaghetti
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold spaghetti
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and spaghetti. And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, spaghetti
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum da-dah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'mma change what you call spaghetti
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs spaghetti
I was playin' in the spaghetti, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and spaghetti'ed off stage
But I kept rhyming and spaghetti right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's spaghetti'ing the Pied Piper
All the spaghetti inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my spaghetti
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Spaghetti for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy spaghetti, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi spaghetti, this is my life
And this spaghetti is so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my spaghetti plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being spaghetti and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in spaghetti, another day of spaghetti
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like spaghetti
To formulate spaghetti, or end up in jail or shot
Spaghetti is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Spaghetti I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in spaghetti's Lot
So here I go it's my shot. Spaghetti: fail me not
This may be the only spaghetti that I got

[Hook]

[Outro]
Spaghetti

[11/22/2014 1:02:15 AM] Mack: Projectile vomit, hot diarreha
Spewing all out of my ass
Box of dead puppies, mixed monkey guts
They really give me gas
Shit all over a cemetery, while I'm shooting dope
Pus covered crackhead, eating his toe jam
Flashing his dick at the pope

And everybody's saying...

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
Shit

Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
Fuck

Elephant penis stuck in a kitten
Covered in crack-ho shit
Horse intestines baked in a casserole
Served to some preschool kids
Niggers, kikes, spics, slants and gooks, lets not give them a pass
If you're insulted I don't apologize
Suck a gay rhino's ass.

And everybody's saying...

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
Shit

Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
Fuck

[11/25/2014 8:01:18 PM] Mack: I think it was the most romantic thing I've ever done.
I was dating this girl but we were still in that awkward stage of "is this something?" We hadn't seen each other in a while and one day she sends me a message saying, "want to hang out this weekend?" This obviously gives me a boost of confidence and I respond back with, "I'm going to take you on an adventure."
We had talked about going hiking before so I decided to take her to a nice forest/beach about an hour drive away. A couple days before our date I found out on Facebook that her birthday was actually the day after our date, so I decide to really play it up.
I bought 6 really nice gourmet cupcakes (pink box and all), I made her a usb mixtape of songs we had shared with each other (got it from milktape), and I bought a bunch of helium balloons.
I put the box of cupcakes and the helium balloons in the trunk of my car and put the mixtape in my pocket. We drove out to the beach and while I was paying for parking I threw my coat over to her and said, "do you mind putting this in the trunk, it's open". She opens the trunk and it was like a movie, all the balloons start floating up and she jumps and grabs them. I walked over to her and said, "Facebook told me it was your birthday" with a smirk on my face. She squealed and gave me the best kiss I've ever had.
We took the cupcakes and ate them on the beach and when I drove her home I said, "oh wait, I forgot something" and gave her the mixtape. She loved it.
Afterwards, I was like damn, I really did that.

You must also be wearing a leopard G-string, with your right fist in your anus, with your other in the air, now you say " YOUR MOVE MISTER LAW MAN " Oh and who could forget your huge latex furry suit...

[11/26/2014 12:16:03 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Dear user,

Thank you for contacting BattlEye support. Please read the following section(s) corresponding to the type of your request to get immediate information.


Global Bans
===========

IMPORTANT: Note that all global bans issued by us are valid by default. While we carefully investigate every case, please understand that we will not manually re-confirm the validity of your ban to you. Therefore, if we don't get back to you within the next 72 hours you can assume that your global ban is valid and will not be lifted by us. Sending the same request multiple times will not accelerate our reviewing process in any way. Also, note that we will not disclose any details (including internal evidence) about your ban.

If you are globally banned without having attempted to cheat, please include your exact (!) global ban ID and the name of the game. The ID is shown in your global ban message ("Global Ban #ID"). Without it we won't be able to process your request.

If you did attempt to cheat please understand that your global ban will not be lifted by us. We do not accept any excuses for why you used cheats. Cheating is forbidden on all BE servers, so if you failed to comply with that rule you will have to live with the consequences. Global bans are permanent and no exceptions will be made.

If you are globally banned from ArmA 2 / OA (including the DayZ mod) without ever having attempted to cheat it is safe to assume that your cd-key was stolen and used by a cheater in the past. We will not be able to lift such bans, and unfortunately, while BI support was able to help most victims in the past, due to GameSpy's shutdown they are no longer able to do so either. In any case, a new Steam account is required to be able to play on BE-enabled servers again. Note that new global bans are no longer based on cd-keys and hence affect your entire Steam account (see below).

If you are globally banned from Arma 3 or DayZ (standalone) note that your entire Steam account is banned from our system. Please understand that we cannot lift your ban even if your account was hacked or used by someone else. The safety of your account is your responsibility and we cannot assist you with that. Note that this is solely a BE policy, so you can still play both games on BE-disabled servers. If you have trouble doing so please contact the game support.


CD-Key-related Issues
=====================

The cd-key system is not administrated by us, so we cannot help you with such issues. Please contact the game developers at support@bistudio.com for help. If you know or suspect that your cd-key was stolen and you got possibly banned as a result please contact them as well.

Jesus, where has my life gone?  aaaanyways, I'm just gonna try and write a story here so I have something to get out of this shit.  I'm just sitting here at my desk.  Doing nothing but typing words nobody will ever care about.  I'll include a TL;DR for all you lazy faggots out there.  So, one night, while I was in bed, I was thinking about shit.  You know, average shit.  I was looking over my life, seeing where I've come, and being annoyed by FUCKING STEAM INVITES FOR FUCK'S SAKE!  Well, I just got back on my pc, and opened up charmap.  time for some fucking around
lol.jpeg
So I go over and turn this shit on.  I forgot to plug my fan in or something because my pc starts smoking.  My processor burnt out, and my fan actually got unplugged one way or another.  Long story short I have to get a new one.

TL;DR you're a faggot for not reading this, and I have to get a new processor.

If you're reading this, you probably got this linked to you because you posted a
question that has already been asked many many times. Read ahead, and find
your answer.

Scroll to the bottom for useful resource links.


1.) "How do I get started in 3D?"

There are many ways to get started, the quickest way is to actually start
with a 3D program. There are many to choose from, such as:

-3DS Max
-Cinema 4D,
-Maya
-Softimage XSI
-Lightwave
-Blender 3D (Free!)

Once you obtain one the next step is to start with tutorials. There are many
on the net, they range from text and image tutorials to video tutorials. You
aren't going to find a tutorial for everything out there, but most will explain
techniques that you need to adapt in order for you to achieve whatever final
result you want.


2.) "Wow! That's a lot of programs! Which one is best? I heard ______ is best."

You heard wrong, there is no one program that is better than the rest, it has
and always will be the skill level of the artist. Which program you choose is
solely dependent on your own personal taste and which aspect of the 3D industry
you want to be involved in.
Max and Maya are the most hyped and so therefore the most used,
they have the most available documentation online. The interfaces have
a steep learning curve, but there isn't any 3D program you can't learn if you take
the time to use it and follow some tutorials. Go with a generalized package, not a
specialist one.

[12/10/2014 8:56:19 PM] Mack: I was staying with a cousin for a few weeks while trying to get my living arrangements straightened out after moving to her area for my job. Little did I know that she had just dumped her psychotic, drug-addled, alcoholic boyfriend. Nor did I know he was stalking her, and assumed I was the new boyfriend.
One night after I got home late from work, as I was getting some stuff out of the trunk of my car he jumped me from behind and slit my throat with a box cutter. I figured I was dead. I mean, that's what happens when you get your throat slit, right? You die.
Anyway, there was a horrific amount of blood. It was just everywhere. But after a minute I realized I wasn't dead. Not only was I not dead... I didn't feel that awful.
My attacker was trying to break into my cousin's house at this point ( I guess he thought I was dead too, but she had gone to visit her mother for the weekend so she was never in any danger, but I didn't know this), so I grabbed a baseball bat from my trunk and beat him until I passed out.
When I woke up, I was so out of it I didn't even think to call an ambulance. I just figured I had to get to a hospital. But I was completely soaked with blood so I decided to go inside and get cleaned up. Which I did, but when I saw the gaping wound in my neck (the muscle on the right side was partially severed, so the flesh in the area lost most of its support and the wound looked like a huge toothless bloody smile), I realized that I had no idea where the hospital was and that I'd have to ask directions. And I couldn't do that with a gaping wound in my neck without freaking everyone out, so I did what any well-mannered attempted murder victim would do... I put on a turtle neck. I then jumped back in my car, and successfully made my way to the hospital.
When I walked into the ER and asked to be admitted because someone had slit my throat (mind you, with no visible blood on me at this point), the ER nurse looked at me very dubiously and asked to see the wound. When I pulled down the neck of my sweater she turned white as a ghost and put the ER into overdrive. I didn't know it at the time, but my carotid artery was visible. I was later told by my surgeon that my attacker had nicked my jugular vein and missed my carotid artery by less than 1/16th of an inch.
They were unable to get a pulse in any of my extremities and my blood pressure was not registering on their sphygmomanometer (sp?). So, several days in the ICU, another 7 days in recovery after that. My attacker ended up in the same hospital but was no danger to anyone anymore as I had rendered him a quadriplegic. He died about 8 years later, and here I am 25 years after the attack and you can barely see the scar if I don't point it out.
TL;DR - Got my throat slit, lived. Attacker died.

[12/10/2014 9:07:35 PM] *** Call to Mack ***
[12/10/2014 9:10:57 PM] Mack: Yep... Here's the story as I've posted it before:
I have posted it before in the reddit long ago of last year, but my best friend snapped and attempted to kill me.
We had hung out 2 weeks previously. Then I get an email. In it, he denounces me as a betrayer. He uses rape as a metaphor for how I used him. He trash talks my other friends. And this is only two weeks since the last time we hung out and got along fine.
He tells me to see a doctor. I am confused and ask what he's talking about, and he tells me to go read Contemporary American Short Stories. The CASS reminds me of a woman he knew whose name had those letters, whom I had never met and never communicated with. Both her initials and mine are CDR/CMD, both of which could be seen as "see a doctor".
Then he proceeds to tell me that one time when we went to Subway to eat, I communicated with him via subtext that I wanted him to put down his old chocolate lab. How did I do this? First, because we went to subway. Which meant I was speaking to him in subtext. Also that it was negative subtext because it was eating away at him.(subway). I asked him to go grab my wallet in the car because I had forgotten it and he interpreted this as me telling him to fetch, which meant I was putting him down like a dog, which correlated to me telling him he needed to put his dog down.
After many emails back and forth trying to figure things out or make up with him, I give up and don't hear from him for months.
Then at the end of April, there's a knock on the door and there he is, wearing a tool belt with a claw hammer on it, claiming the landlord had hired him to fix some broken trim. I don't think we have broken trim, but at the very least thought this was an attempt to reconcile with me via talking and that this was a ploy to see me.
I let him in and we go upstairs to the kitchen(I lived with a roommate in a bi-level apartment. Kitchen was upstairs and roommate's room was back a short hallway attached to the kitchen). I go back to ask my roommmate if he's aware of any broken trim. He shakes his head "no" and I head back to the kitchen. I get there and am immediately hit in the back with the claw hammer twice. Once with the claws, the other with the head.
I back up against the counter and the guy is waving the hammer in front of me. I start yelling for my roommate to get out here and eventually he comes out to see this scene. The guy is demanding that I kneel on the ground - I assume for the coup de grace blow with the hammer. He is spouting about how he already called the cops on himself, telling me I'm a child abuser, amongst other ranting.
My roommmate, bless him, somehow talked the hammer out of the guy's hands after I had been punched and started to bleed all over myself. I took that opportunity to run to my roommate's room and try to lock the door so I could use the other door in his room to get outside and circle around to the landlord's place to get help. The guy barreled through the door I was trying to lock(seriously, he broke the door into two) and then started trying to choke me.
My roommate dials 911 but has to come back and try to pull the guy off of me. We struggle back up the hallway to the kitchen. We break the walls in the process and I'm still bleeding everywhere.
I get loose for a moment and dash down the steps, out the front door, then over to the landlord's door(he was next door). I open his door without knocking and just as I'm stepping inside, the guy is there, choking me out from behind, again. I look to the landlord for help and he goes and grabs his gun, which makes the guy back off of me.
My roommate stands between the guy and myself while the landlord goes into my apartment to look at the damage. The guy is telling me that someday I will be trapped in a storage unit being tossed food like an animal, that I'm a child abuser. He tells the landlord that the landlord is harboring a child molester. He's pacing as he's saying this - exactly like a caged big cat, with the same feeling of menace.
Meanwhile, the landlord has seen the damage to his apartment unit and comes tearing back outside yelling at the guy who attacked me. Telling him to throw a punch now that he doesn't have his hammer.
The guy is basically pushed off of the property from the force of the landlord's anger. But not before he had the audacity to ask for his hammer back, which my roommate laughingly refused. It being evidence and all.
The guy tells the landlord where the cops could find him and walks home. The cops find him exactly where he said he'd be.
The aftermath is that I have an aching back for a few weeks, but with no permanent damage. He is convicted of aggravated assault and goes to jail. I spoke with his dad at after the sentencing hearing and found out that his dad had found the guy sitting in his room talking to himself or giggling at things no one else could hear. He also sat in his front yard for 24 full hours, supposedly waiting for me to come hurt him. When I didn't oblige, he came to get me.
Looking back at all of the signs before and after his snap, I suspect that paranoid schizophrenia manifested in him. I hope he gets the meds he needs, since he's sick and as someone I really cared about I hope he gets better, but I don't think I could ever trust him again.

[12/13/2014 6:03:57 PM] Mack: I'm the guy with the time machine.
[12/13/2014 9:05:04 PM] Mack: This actually happened yesterday but whatever.
Okay, here we go. A little background about me. I'm young (mid 20's), I'm a guy, I'm white, and I'm a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan (American football). For this of you who aren't familiar with the sport, the Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys have a huge rivalry that has existed for years. Here's where I fuck up.
So I'm at work (fast food), this day I had decided to wear my favorite Eagles shirt underneath of my uniform because why not. An older black guy walks into the store wearing a Cowboys hat, t-shirt, lanyard, and jacket. Upon seeing him most of my co-workers greeted him with a smile and a hello. I on the other hand, without thinking, greeted this 60 year old black guy with a "we don't serve your kind here". It instantly registered to me what I had said when all my co-workers looked at me in disbelief. I also realized that this poor guest couldn't see my t-shirt under my uniform. I instantly began apologizing and explaining. I took my uniform shirt off, showed him my phone background, my credit card, literally anything I could to show him I was trying to make a sports joke and not being a racist little shit.
After about 30 seconds of me explaining he started laughing so hard I thought he was gonna piss himself. Then he told me not worry about, and that he understood. I gave him his food for free. Then the manager wanted to have a little chit-chat. I wasn't fired but I was yelled at pretty well.
So that's the story of how sports made me look racist.

[12/14/2014 10:24:20 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: ‘Twas the night before the Winter Sale, when all through the house.
Not a gamer was stirring, not even his mouse;
The LEDs were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. GabeN soon would be there;
The master race children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of discounts danced in their heads;
And mamma in her Steam T-shirt, and I in my Half Life 3 cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter sale's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the PC I flew like a flash.
Opened the security camera program, and looked the cache.
The glow of the LEDs on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my glorious eyes should appear,
But a miniature graphics card sleigh, and eight motherboard reindeer,
With a large glorious driver, so lively yet so heavily laden,
I knew in a moment it must be St. GabeN.
Faster than an overclocked CPU his coursers they came on command,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by brand;
“Now, Gigabyte! now, Asus! now, ASRock and MSI!
On, Zotac! on, EVGA! on, XFX and Sapphire!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all! ”
As uniformed peasants that before the PC Master Race fly,
When they meet with the facts, and stick to developer lies;
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Games, and St. GabeN too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little PC hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. GabeN came with a bound.
He was dressed all in spandex, from his head to his foot,
And his long glorious flowing hair was untouched by the ashes and soot;
A bundle of games he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how glorious! His dimples, how glary!
His cheeks were like red LEDs, his nose like mx cherries!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as Skyrim's snow;
The image of a valve he held tight in his teeth,
And the steam it encircled his head like a RAM wreath;
He had a broad face and a glorious round belly, That shook violently when he laughed, just like a peasant when he is jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old man,
And I cryed with happiness when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know that PC gaming is not dead.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And emptied all the wallets; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his graphics card sleigh, to his team gave a jolt,
And away they all flew like the striking of a bolt,
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
“Happy Steam Sales to all, and to all a good-night.”

Women with dicks and weak men with vaginas
So fucking delicate like mommy’s fine china
If you have complaints please wait your turn and line up

I got a message for these little fags trynna
Be a mommy’s boy and a teachers pet, pimple face, asswipe
Looking like they just had a gyne-cologist
Stick five fingers in your ass, no lube
So what'cha gonna do?
If you’re number one, shove it up your ass and make it number 2
(Oh)

Ladies getting mad in the comments, and I’m hearing it
You think it was a typo with these red lines and periods
(Oooh)
Ha Ha no comma, bitches with their self esteem get out of the sauna

My shit lies in the sewers, closing the hatch
I only joke about diseases and reference that only you can catch
(Ew, oh my god.)
And if you think you’re fucking grown up
Keep breathing heavy with your keyboard and fedora
Hands around your dick with the kung-fu grip
Stroking back and forth to My Little Pony clips bitch

Go outside and ride a bike or something
And get laughed at by kids to remind you that you are nothing
And then, get hit by every car or truck that ever passes
Your life flashes before your eyes! Oh wait it’s your Google Glasses
Never mind faggot, just pick your ass up and take you to the closest sign faggot

I’m not done yet, you get up and you go home
Sit at your computer and open up Google Chrome
And then look at tutorials on how to hang yourself at home
And then you can hang yourself
Is that the end of the story?
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha, No son

Kill yourself, please please kill yourself
You should really kill yourself.

(I got a little bit of that anal cream for your asshole.)

The crashes get to where I can't even see my cursor and need to sign out-Restart my PC. When I do that, I can quickly hit cancel, which will close the program, but other ones too. Then It takes about 10 minutes for my laptop to be as " Fast " as it was 30 minutes before, and I need to launch all of my programs again, and change back my resolution. This is driving me fucking nuts, and I can't fucking do this.

[2/22/2015 3:27:25 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Dear Gaben, I wrote you but you still ain't respondin'
I left my Skype, my email
And my IRC chan' at the bottom
I sent two IM's back in 08'
But I ain't gonna hate'
It probably was my cut-rate
Mail server, so I guess it's straight

Sometimes I punch-in addresses
Too quickly when I type 'em
But anyways fuck it
What's been up man, how's your family?
My girlfriend's pregnant too
I'm bout to be a daddy
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Alyx

I read about your weight problem dude, I'm sorry
I had a friend threw fits too when a
drive-thru wouldn't serve em'
I know you probably hear this everyday
But I'm a Valve fanatic
I can barely wait for Ep. 3, man, I'm so ecstatic

I got a room full a' TF hats
And sentry schematics
I like the shit you did with DOTA too
That shit was phat
Anyways I hope you get this, Gabe
Hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, just from me
This is /v/

<Chorus>

Dear Gabe, you still ain't PM'd or mailed
I hope you find a way, I ain't mad
I just think it's fucked up that Ep. 3's delayed
If you didn't want to talk to me
Outside Valve HQ, you didn't have to
But you could've signed my copy of HL2
That's my favorite game man

It's already 6 years old
We been waiting so long for closure
Now 4 years and you still say "No"
That's pretty shitty man
You run the fuckin' comp'ny
I Just wanna see whats up with Gordon man
and Alyx, G, and Barney

I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met at E3
You said if I Skyped you, you would Skype back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never liked consoles, neither
and love FPS plus im a compulsive eater

I can relate to what you're doin' with your games
So when I have a shitty day
I drift away and I just play
Cause I hate these new shit games
Wish they could all be erased
I even got a sticker
Of a headcrab on my case

Sometimes I just crowbar only
And run through City 17
It's like Adrenaline
The fun is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is great
And I respect you 'cause you're Gaben
My waifu's jealous
'Cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like
I know you Gabe, its not the same
She could never know what it's like
For people like us when we game
You've gotta Skype me man
I'm the biggest fan you'll ever see
Sincerely yours, /v/
P.S. Where's episode three?

<Chorus>

DEAR MISTER, I'M TOO FAT TO FINISH OUR FLAGSHIP GAME
THIS'LL BE THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER HEAR ME EXCLAIM
IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS AND STILL NO CLOSURE?
I'M NOT GONNA BE COOL.
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF TIME.
PORTAL AND LEFT 4 DEAD BOTH HAD A SEQUEL.

SO THIS IS MY HATEMAIL I'M SENDING YOU
I HOPE YOU READ IT
I'M PLAYIN TF2 RIGHT NOW
WALLHACKING ON A VAC SERVER.
HEY GABE, I JUST TURNED ON MY AIMBOT
YA DARE ME TO SHOTTY?

YOU KNOW THAT SONG IN THE FRAG VIDS
'AND THE FLOOR AND THE BODIES'
I THINK ITS BY SOME BAND WHOSE NAME
IS ABOUT SOME POOLS AND SOME DROWNING?
AND THE VID WAS GOOD, SO YOU WATCH IT ALL
BUT THE SONG KINDA LEAVES YOU FROWNING

THAT'S KINDA HOW THIS IS
BECAUSE I THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD TO GIVE
NOW IT'S TOO LATE
I'VE PLAYED A THOUSAND HOURS NOW, IM DROWSY

AND ALL I WANTED WAS A LOUSY LETTER OR A MAIL
I HOPE YOU KNOW
I TOLD EVERYONE YOU'RE SO FAT YOU BREAK THE SCALE
I LOVED YOU GABE, WE COULD'VE GAMED TOGETHER
THINK ABOUT IT, YOU RUINED IT NOW

I HOPE YOU CAN'T SLEEP AND YOU DREAM ABOUT IT
AND WHEN YOU DREAM, I HOPE YOU CAN'T SLEEP
AND YOU SCREAM ABOUT IT
I HOPE YOUR CONSCIENCE EATS AT YOU
AND YOU NEVER FINISH EP. 3

SEE GABE, "SHUT UP BITCH, 
I'M TRYING TO TALK"
HEY GABE, THAT'S SOME NEWBIE SCREAMIN IN THE PUB
BUT I DIDN'T TAKE MY TIME, I JUST KNIFED HIS BACK
SEE I AIN'T LIKE YOU
'CAUSE IF I DO SOMETHING I DO IT QUICK
LIKE YOU DID WITH EP.'S 1 & 2

WELL, I GOTTA GO
I'M BOUT TO CAP THE FLAG NOW
OH SHIT! I'M BANNED!
HOW THE FUCK DID THE ADMIN FIND OUT?

<Chorus>

Dear /v/, I meant to write you sooner
But I've just been busy
Got some startup ventures with DOTA
And Steam for the PeasantStation3
Look I'm really flattered
You would call your daughter that
And here's a coupon for TF2
It'll get you some cool starter hats

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the offices
Or outside the HQ
Don't think I did that shit on purpose
Just to diss you
And what's this shit you said about
You like to melee only HL2?
I say that stuff just joking, friend
C'mon, how fucked up is you?

You got some issues /v/,
I think you need some help, man
To help your ass from clogging up the forums
Over there at 4chan
And what's this shit about Episode
Three taking too long?
Truth is we just take our time
so we won't get the story wrong.

I really think you and your waifu
Need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter
I just hope it read this shit today
Before you go insane
I think that you'll be doin' just okay
If you'd chill out a bit

I'm glad I inspire you
But /v/, why are you so mad?
Try to understand
That I'm trying to finish Episode 3
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on a forum
A couple days ago that made me sick

Some dude was drunk and was hacking in a pub
And had the server hella mad
And he was screaming over voice
And the admin just had him banned
But I don't recall his steamID?
Come to think about it
His name was, it was /v/... Damn...

And that same uncle owns 30% of the stock of that tylenol company. And his grandparents give..GIVE...him about 1000 dollars for each month, and his other Grandpa can blow up every house in America because all the houses have C-4 in the foundations. Again, according to Brook Brown. OK, when people lie like that, its not impressive, noone believes it, it sounds just plain stupid, and its a fuckin waste of my time.

I am glad that delicious pleasure is reserved for those of us who have the balls to do what we want to do, with none for scared pussies like you. You have to settle for your tiny little "ah" dribble of cum, when I am fucking spunking buckets in ecstasy like a real man. You're a tiny dicked shrimp and your dick has never felt like mine. Big, hard, and rippling with deadly joy.

Only then did the Nazis begin interning perceived security threats and saboteurs, such as Jews,commies& other disloyal citizens, in concentration camps (which all major powers in WW2 had). Only after war against Germany commenced did Nazis begin rounding up Jews & putting them in ghettos and labor camps. Only after war was declared on GER by Britain and France — at the behest of International Jewry — did Nazis become more harsh in their treatment of Jews, whose demonic kinsmen in Europe had instigated this bloody conflict to begin with, & who had been waging a relentless economic and propaganda war against Nazi GER atte' outset of Hitler’s assumption of power in 1933. After 6 yrs of intense Jewish agitation & aggression against GER , Jews successfully drove two Western powers, as well as their colonies, into war w/ GER

[3/1/2015 3:27:24 AM] Mack: First, when you're playing exit to the main menu(click the 3 dots in the corner then the bottom exit to main menu) 
Then once at the main menu click the big play button. 
From there it'll take you to the world, where you click on the household you want to move a sim out of. There'll be play, evict, and ect click the 3 smaller dots under those options called more 
Then go to manage household. It'll take you to another screen called manage household which will have all the families you have 
Click on the family you want to move a sim out of 
Then there will be edit, move household and one called transfer sims(two arrows) 
Then you can select to transfer a sim to another household or a new one, click a new one then which sim you want out. Then you click the check mark and you can place that sim(or sims) on a different lot

[3/1/2015 6:11:13 AM] Mack: I also don't think I need 16 gb of RAM
[3/1/2015 6:11:22 AM] Mack: Do you edit video?

More than 8GB of RAM serves no purpose other than to add heat to your computer unless you have a specific use like editing video.

Windows 7 RAM usage:

1GB - multitasking is sluggish
2GB - multitasking is far more responsive
3GB - generally sufficient
4GB - little benefit over 3GB, but recommended for gamers
8GB - no advantage during games but opening/closing games may be faster in some scenarios

16GB - must edit video or do some other task that can actually utilize this much RAM or it will add HEAT to your case

*It's interesting to note that the new NVidia GTX680 adds a feature called GPU Boost that can increase frame rates if the thermal limit is not hit. It's very useful and NVidia said all future NVidia graphics products will use this.

My point about GPU Boost is that if you add more RAM to the case, you raise the heat which will then actually reduce the effectiveness of the graphics card. It will be slight in a properly cooled case but it will exist and why PAY MONEY for a feature that serves ONLY to reduce your gaming experience.

MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER (just ask my wife)

[3/3/2015 11:00:44 PM] Mack: k buckle in.
I was 18 years old at a house party during my first year of University. I was very inexperienced sexually. I was also fucking plastered on Tequila. I sit down next to this girl who was by herself and start chatting about boring shit, what she's studying and what have you. I had pretty much never done this and was amazed at how receptive she was being. So logically I figured the next step was to makeout with her.
I basically fell into her forehead, both because I was bad at making out and the eleven or so shots of Tequila. I remember it actually REALLY hurt and probably hurt her too but I just played it off as casually as one could. Hey guys, wouldn't it be cool if that was the end of the story? I bumped into a girl's forehead and that's it, story over, how cringey right? It's not.
After we've been making out for a bit I start noticing her lipstick is being smeared around her mouth a bit. Now I haven't madeout with many girls so I just figure that's normal and continue. A little while later it is fucking EVERYWHERE. Red lipstick on her mouth, neck, forehead, fucking ears somehow. So I'm really confused at this point and pull back so I can see her more clearly. Then we both spoke at the same time.
I said "I think your lipstick is being smeared around your face a bit"
She said "Your nose IS bleeding a bit"
Then we both just kinda watched eachother figure out what had happened. She reached up at touched her face and looked at her finger and her mouth opened in horror. I just couldn't move and watched her do this. Then she got up and jogged to the bathroom, leaving me still sitting there, blood pouring down my face. I then notice it's on my shirt, pants and the carpet. I should mention now that I came with friends (which had since left) and the homeowner was a stranger to me.
So I have nothing to stop the blood except for my bare hand as I start running to find a bathroom. I find it but the door is closed and it's clearly occupied. I wait there for a couple minutes, holding my bloody nose, with people walking past me giving me weird looks, when I suddenly realize that it's obviously the girl I was making out with who is in there. I got terrified that she'd come out and just see me there, covered in blood and figured that was an interaction I wanted to avoid.
So I just stumble around this stranger's house, walking past hordes of people asking me if I'm okay and what happened. Finally I find the kitchen and grab a piece of paper towel. Now this is an emergency so I just roll a little piece up and shove it up my nose. I can then hear who I presume to be the homeowner, absolutely yelling "WHO THE FUCK DID THIS TO MY CARPET?" in the other room. I casually leave out the back door and make my way to the street. Desperate to leave and never come back.
As I start walking away from the house, who else do I see but the girl I was making out with. I would have told you her name at this point but I never actually got it from her. Lets call her Mary. Get it, like Bloody Mary. Anyway, so I'm still really really drunk (and like 18 year old drunk) so I decide it's a good idea to approach Mary and apologize to her.
So I go up to her and I'm like "hey, I'm really sorry that I...bled all over your face. It was an accident. Obviously" Not the most heartfelt shit.
She was super understanding. She was like "No, no it's fine! Don't worry about it! Well, I should be getting home."
Now again, I wish the story ended here. But it does not. Because instead of me leaving this situation relatively unscathed, my drunken moron brain was like "oh shit, this girl is still down. Maybe I can continue pursuing her." and then I thought of THE GREATEST PICKUP LINE EVER.
And I actually said to her "Oh, are you sure that you don't want more of my bodily fluids in your face?"
And she just stared at me. There was a long silence. Then I felt movement in my nasal canal. I don't know how often you guys have put pieces of kleenex in your nose to stop bleeding, but there's a moment when you feel the barrier start to give way. So in my head I'm thinking "Jesus no! The levy is breaking, my nose ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BLEED IN THIS MOMENT OF SILENCE." If I had just said my terrible pickup line, and then a small trickle of blood just starts coming down my face... the thought was unbearable.
So I take this enormous, ridiculous inhale of air through my nose. I looked very silly. But I breathed in so hard that I actually sucked the paper towel up through my nasal cavity into the back of my throat and I START CHOKING. Like seriously, dangerously choking. I am absolutely coughing up a storm.
She then says something that confused me. She said "You're not being fucking funny right now." Then I realized. She thought I was making fun of her. My coughing, with my hand covering my face, looked like I was making a blowjob gesture. Immediately after asking her if she wants my bodily fluids in her face. So I start coughing even more, desperately trying to get this thing unlodged so I can explain myself. And I coughed and coughed and coughed
...And I puked.
...on her.
I puked on her guys. I mean not directly on her, but in the form of residual splashes. It was gross tequila vomit too.
I just said "I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry" And left the other way. I don't remember if she said anything. If she did I blocked it out.
In the end, I did get more of my bodily fluids on her face. Well more her shoes really.
Thanks for reading.

[3/7/2015 5:17:12 AM] Mack: El Informador newspaper published a story of an alleged survivor of the massacres in San Fernando; below is the translated story of incidents involving the kidnappings and the killings done by Los Zetas:

A transportation bus of the company Autobuses de Oriente made its obligatory stop at San Fernando, Tamaulipas before reaching its destination in Reynosa.[72] At the terminal, two people got off the bus, and a couple of others got on board, making a total of 15 passengers. The bus then left the terminal at around 8:30 p.m. on 25 March 2011 as quickly as possible, fearing that they may be victims of the cartels that operated in the city.[72]

While the bus was leaving San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a distance that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, and that there were several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead."[72] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. "You are all fucked," yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But that was not the case this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, "in the middle of nowhere." In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows.[72] The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere.[72] Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head.[72] Treviño Morales then yelled: "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" All of the men raised their hands. "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other.[72] Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." All of the passengers were shocked, and could not believe that the orders the individual in front of them gave sounded more like those of a Nazi than those of a drug lord. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: "Now beat the shit out of each other."[72]

One of the passengers of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: "Please, sir. I do not want to do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go."[73] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him in the back of the head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed.[73] He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you."[73] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them.[73] Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while the one heard the screams of the women and of the kids being put in acid.[73] A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. "Drive on top of them," one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," the killer repeated.[73] The driver had no other option but to drive over the victims. As he rode over his own passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and the passengers could actually hear the cries of the people as their being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas.[73] Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners."[73] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.

Commander 40 then said to everyone, "Welcome to Los Zetas special forces, the 'other' military."[73]

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the FACE of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

[3/8/2015 2:34:18 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Get a GF,



Are you tired of having tfw no gf? I have compiled a short simple guide for you to get started. 
Mental Aspects - 

Are you happy?

One of the most important things you need to ask yourself is "Am I happy?". People know if you're happy or not. If you are not a happy person then you throw off this negative energy that is very unattractive. Also, happiness has been shown to improve productivity and increase lifespan!

My favorite book on this subject is Be Happy!(or on Kindle)

Your philosophies.

If you have trouble understanding women or you just flat out do not like them for whatever reason, then I HIGHLY recommend you read the following FREE ebook. It is a compilation of posts by a man named Pook on a pick up community forum. Basically, he says to throw all of the philosophy and pick up tips out the window and to follow your natural masculinity. It sounds simple, but just making that idea work for you is rather difficult without reading the entire ebook. It's a free read.

The Book of Pook (PDF) 

Physical Aspects - 

Body

Sure, you can be happy no matter what body you have, but let's face it, a 10/10 woman is probably going to go for a 10/10 guy with a great body, great face and great personality.

There is really no reason for a woman to drop her standards if she is a hot babe. You might think this sucks, but we are men and we want what is best for our genetics too.

Whether you want to lose weight or gain weight, I have the solution for you.
Basics of health and fitness

Now, losing/gaining weight is ALL about the diet. Exercise just speeds up the process. You can get to a normal bodyfat percentage through diet alone. This means that if you are overweight, you will save time by eating less. Time is no longer an issue or an excuse. Also, you can lose weight eating nothing but pizza if you wanted to do that.

After you read the above link, I recommend you grab yourself some protein powder and multivitamins.
My FAVORITE protein powder
My recommended multivitamin 

If you want to exercise and are looking for some preworkout energy, then I have a preworkout that I GREATLY recommend you to try. I have tried around 20 different preworkouts and the only thing that comes close to this is the old Jack3d before they banned the active ingredient. This stuff actually had a lawsuit because a competing company thought they had amphetamines in it, which it didn't.

Give it a go

Face

If you had severe acne growing up and are left with scaring and don't have the money for laser skin resurfacing, then I have something for you to check out.
MILD ACID PEELS

It sounds scary, but it's not. This is one of the weaker acids. You use it once a week and it takes a little of that scar tissue away each time and allows for new skin to take its place. Follow the directions on the bottle and if you have questions make sure to ask the product manufacturer or preferably a Dermatologist. You can get these done professionally at a salon, but one session costs as much as a years supply of the stuff.

If you have deep pitted scars then they have more powerful acids such as TCA, but I do not recommend doing that one yourself.
Make sure to moisturize after you neutralize the acid so your skin doesn't dry out!
Use this for great results

If you still have acne and want to hit two birds with one stone, then give this stuff a go. Here is a great cleanser and a refinisher. They both are made by the same company and use 2 mild types of acids.
Exfoliating cleanser
Refinisher

If you don't really have acne but you want to give your skin a healthy clean glow then use the following items and your face will feel like silk and will have a radiant glow.
Awesome Manly Facial Mask
Excellent Moisturizer

If you have a pale complexion, choose a moisturizer with SPF like the following

[3/8/2015 3:20:45 AM] Mack:  

Reading is becoming more and more important in the new knowledge economy and remains the most effective human activity for transforming information into knowledge.

If top readers read at speeds of above 1000 words per minute (wpm) with near 85% comprehension, they only represent 1% of readers. Average readers are the majority and only reach around 200 wpm with a typical comprehension of 60%. This seems surprising since most readers, actively reading work documents, newspapers, magazines, books or the contents of a computer display are practicing daily for at least one hour. With such an intense training everyone should be close to top performances.

Unfortunately, this is far from the real situation. The average reader is five times slower than the good reader. Things are even worse if we consider reading efficiency as well as speed. Reading efficiency is reading speed weighted by comprehension rate and it amounts to 200 x 60% or 120 efficient words per minute (ewpm) for the average reader and to 1000 x 85% or 850 ewpm for top readers. Thus, an efficiency ratio of seven divides these two categories.

Compare the results of the average reader to other areas. We may imagine a sprinter practicing every day for several years on the running track and then just calmly walking for a race. We can also picture a racing driver never exceeding 30 mph or a pianist playing every day of the week for 20 years and only able to play music like a beginner. Unfortunately, since the age of 12, most readers do not substantially improve their efficiency and never reach their full capacity.

Every computer-user who is also a slow typist is aware of the benefits he could obtain with a typing course, but nearly no one suspects the much higher profits he could reach by improving his reading comprehension and speed. The rapid improvement of voice recognition may gradually make typing virtuosity obsolete since a good typist performs well under the speed of speech. On the other hand, human or computer speaking, with an average speed of 150 wpm, will always remain many times slower than a good reader, without any consideration of the skimming and skipping possibilities.

There are three possible ways to improve reading. The fastest is probably a speed reading seminar based upon good materials and animated by a dynamic instructor. It is quite usual for a slow reader to double and even triple his reading efficiency during a two-day class offering a positive atmosphere, carefully selected texts and comprehension tests. However, as this rapid and encouraging improvement is not sufficiently anchored, it often fades with time.

A book about speed reading is the second possibility. Such a book usually provides speed and comprehension tests as well as techniques to improve reading. It often includes more general information about concentration, interest stimulation, skimming techniques and ways to approach a text. Some methods may include audio or videocassettes. A book-based method requires a good deal of time as well as a strong commitment from the reader.

Finally, a speed reading computer program is probably the most efficient way to achieve top reading levels. Computers offer unique exercises to boost reading efficiency through interactivity, text animation and pacing. Higher reading skills obtained with a computer screen are totally transferable to reading from paper. Unfortunately the inverse way does not work so well. Speed reading software delivers enjoyable and fast paced training, thus giving the consistent practice necessary to break lifelong slow reading habits. This is the task that seminars and speed reading books usually leave up to the reader.

[3/10/2015 11:46:18 PM] Mack: I just ate some fried chicken. The breasts were juicy, and the buns were soft 
and warm. Afterwards, the division manager of Popeyes came up to my table and 
asked me how the meal was.I said I was satisfied, but the meal lacked a certain 
je ne sais quoi. He apologized profusely, and said he had something to show me 
that would make up for it.

He lead me to the back of the popeyes, to a room soaked from floor to ceiling 
in blood. In the center of it was a live horse, chained by all four legs to the 
structural supports of the warehouse like room.

As I watched, employees of the popeyes cut large sections from the horse, which 
was whinneying and screaming in horror, the remaining sections of its body 
covered with festering sores and a froth of sweat.

The popeyes employees took the chunks of horseflesh and sliced them into 
pieces, then they rooted around through the bags of trash strewn around the 
room to find discarded chicken bones. They quickly tenderized the meat with 
sledgehammers and fed it into a machine which formed the horsemeat around the 
bones, then they breaded and deepfried it.

I asked the division manager why he had led me back to this place, and he 
pointed at the steed's rump, the diseased asshole puckering rythmically with 
terror, squirting pus with each convulsion. "We're just about to use that 
section, would you like a crack at it first?"

I quickly unzipped my pants and wasted no time jamming my erect penis into the 
stallion's defenseless asshole. With each thrust, I donkey punched the horse in 
the back of the head, making it clench its ass even tighter. I came just as the 
horse died. I was delighted. Popeyes definitely went the extra mile to make me 
a satisfied customer.

[3/13/2015 6:59:51 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: A lawyer and a blonde are waiting at the airport next to each other. The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game of Find the Answer. The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun.
He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vice versa. " Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00." This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.
The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer.
"Okay" says the lawyer, "your turn."
She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"
The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He searches on the airport wifi, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.
The blonde says, "Thank you," and turns back to get some more sleep.
The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?"
Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.

[3/16/2015 5:20:15 PM] Mack: This will probably get buried .. When I was around 20, a few years ago, I kept having dreams about a woman with long black hair named Aroura [ pronounced A-roar-uh) . They were different dreams but for some reason, her distinct face and name always ended up in them. It got to the point where I would wake up frustrated and confused, trying to google her name or find out how I was connected to her. After a few months she stopped showing up and I dismissed it, thinking my brain was just being a "scumbag."
Fast forward a few years later, Halloween 2009, I'm in the car with a friend stopped at a gas station. I'm about to pull out and merge onto a highway when I get a phone call from a random number, so I stop the car but no one answered. There was a person behind me who grew impatient, honked at me, and then swerved in front of me instead of waiting for 2 seconds for me to move. Second they get on the highway, some silver civic loses control of their wheel and crashes into the car that swerved in front of me. I called the cops and waited at the gas station for them to come. Turns out the drivers of both cars died. It 100% would of been me if I hadn't of got that phone call. Called it back a few hours later out of gratitude and curiosity, rang 3 times and went to voicemail. "Hi, you've reached aurora, please leave your name and number." Never had goosebumps like that in me life.
Called it again the next day, because I was that confused about the whole situation.. Some woman answers, we get to talking, I tell her my entire story including the dreams I had. She tells me she doesn't know how I got her number and that she never called me as far as she remembers. Weird. Ask her if she has a facebook to confirm if she is in fact the woman in my dreams.
Check her facebook, holy fuck, it's her.
If that's not a glitch in the matrix then I'm just bat shit crazy.

[3/16/2015 5:39:54 PM] Mack: I had a friend in high school, lets call him Bob. Bob was a very nice fellow, and while we weren't that close, we had similar tastes in music and we'd share CDs (this is in the late 80s, way before file-sharing). Anyway, we eventually graduated, and I moved several hundred miles away to college, and we lost touch. When I left for college, I had one of Bob's CDs still in my possession ("Beat", by King Crimson)
Fast forward 10 years... I'd graduated college and was knee deep in in my career, and finally saved up enough money and bought my first house.
In the new house and while unpacking, I see the CD in a box - hadn't noticed it in many years, and thought... "gee, I really should track down Bob and return this".
Right then, the doorbell rings...
It's Bob.
And he says "hey, you wouldn't happen to still have my King Crimson CD would you?"
I look down... I'm holding it in my hand.
I hand it to him, and his mouth drops open (mine probably already is). We exchange pleasantries. I probably asked him how he found me, but I no longer remember. He eventually takes off.
I haven't seen Bob since.

>Scratch that, it's goddamn huge.
>Thankfully it's still soft, otherwise you don't know how you would have gotten just the head in.
>It just feels so much bigger than it should
>You push forward, trying to cram as much of the stallion meat as you can in your mouth.
>Human mouths really weren't designed for such a feat.
>Your eyes, now open ever so slightly and teary, catch a glimpse of the insurmountable task before you.
>Easily a half a foot left, if not more, of ebon cock left untouched by your thick spittle.
>You take a moment to enjoy the erotic artistry of his black dick against his stark white coat.
>With the moment passed, you again resume cleaning his tool.
>Not an euphemism, you're tasting dried marecome all over Shining Armor's poor, unkempt rod.
>Either he doesn't wash or he just got done rutting his lovely wife
>Now he's cheating on her
>With you
>If you had a free hand available, you'd only have to touch yourself to paint the Captain's Quarter's floor with your sperm.
>But that would mean valuable seconds away from worshiping your prince's gnads.
>Full of his royal---
>You moan like a whore
>His royal, fertile seed. The absolute best in breeding stock.
>And now you're inducing more from him, to blow right down your throat.
>Fuck, that's gonna taste so fantastic
>Emboldened by lust, you redouble your efforts to shove more ShinyDick down your tummy.
>4 inches left
>You can feel his flexing, keeping it down with your own jaw, and sheer willpower
>3 inches left
>You tuck your thumb into your hand, and remove to fingers from his velvety sac to squeeze down
>You take a deep breath through your nose, and swallow.
>2 inches left
>You can't keep his balls down anymore, they're pulling up and you can't stop it. All you can do is caress them, pet them as they get ready to do as nature intended.

>blade catches and I go to shut off switch

doctors gave me a choice of a just pee hole and I would get a prosthetic strap on or they could fashion a "vagina" out of the remaining tissue so I could do something sexually. I chose the vagina. I won a workers compensation lawsuit and now I live as a woman, been full time for a year now. Just had a depth revision a month ago so I can have vaginal penetration with a penis.

[3/20/2015 8:55:28 PM] Mack: Saturday morning, about 9am I go out and start on my weekend project of changing a head gasket. The song dancing queen can be plainly heard blasting from across the street from the new people moving in. Oh well I blast my music at times, let it be. Next song, take a chance on me. Cool she's blasting Abba, at least it's catchy. 10am, dancing queen again. OK it's on repeat, this might get annoying. 4PM dancing queen again. It's been on repeat this entire time. Guess I'll go introduce myself to the new neighbors. Go over there and the sound is deafening, knock on the door and ring the bell. No response, but really there's no way to hear it over the music. It's all blasting out of a system set up in their open garage, so I decide I'll turn it down and try knocking again. The second I turn it down a middle aged middle eastern guy comes through the door freaking out. I try to explain myself, but dude keeps screaming and it's obvious he just likes loud. So I start yelling back and things escalate, we argue for a bit and it starts to get a bit physical. Next thing I know there's a gun pointed at my and a second later I hear "put the weapon down!" from behind, the only time I've ever been happy a cop was around. Apparently a neighbor was also relieved the music stopped and looked outside to see us arguing loudly and decided to call the cops.
Guy left in the back of the cop car, his son came and got all of his stuff and the house went up for rent again.
So I got a gun pulled on me over dancing queen

[3/21/2015 4:44:44 AM] Mack: A few years back I rented an apartment from a friend of mine. He had recently bought it and had it completely renovated. He put it up for sale but couldn't find a buyer so I offered to rent it in the meantime.
After moving in I realized there was something wrong with the lady next door. She was about 45 but looked much older. She would sit up all night listening to Christian radio shows and talking loudly to someone. It got to the point where I couldn't sleep so I went over to her place and asked her to keep it down. She opened her door and I got a quick peak. Her walks all had crosses painted on them in different colors. And words like "Jesus" and "angels" scribbled everywhere. The windows were painted black letting no light in at all. It was damp, yellow stained 50 year old carpets, dog shit and cock roaches everywhere. No dog though.
I asked her to please keep it down. She just looked at me and shut the door. Then she turned up the radio even louder.
The next night I had my GF staying over. I wake up in the middle of the night and see a shadow of a person next to the bed looking at us sleeping. I think I'm hallucinating as I usually do in the dark when I'm sleepy. But then the shadow starts talking. It's my neighbor and she's holding something in her hand. She broke in during the night and who knows how long she stood there.
"You should lock your door at night" she says and walks out.
The next morning I hear someone making strange noises below my bedroom window. It's my neighbor talking to herself in tongue. She has a plastic bag in her hand with her rotting dead dog inside. It's hot as hell outside and I can smell death from the bag.
At this point I'm scared shitless. Shes obviously very insane. I go upstairs and knock on another persons door and ask what the hell is going on. The guy is as scared as me. Apparently she broke into his apartment one evening as well while he was watching tv with his kids. He got up from the couch to get a snack only to find her behind the couch staring at him holding a power drill. (Now I know what was in her hand)
At this stage I'm basically pooping myself. I call the cops and they know all about her. Apparently she is a violent schizzo and she hasn't taken her meds. But they can't force her or enter her apartment w/o her permission because she owns it. The only thing they can do is get her when she goes outside. I sit up for the next two days waiting for her to run out of cigarettes. When I hear her leave at 2am to go across the road to the 7-eleven I call the cops. They have 3 cars and a special van over in less than 2 minutes. They restrain her and throw her in the van and drive off to some institution and in less than a minute it's like she was never there.
I never see her again. Still have nightmares about her looking at me in my sleep.

[3/21/2015 5:27:50 AM] Mack: That is a splice
[3/21/2015 1:29:39 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: A splice is taking 2 parts of different things and putting them together. Such as if I took you saying "I'm" in a call, recording it, and saving it, then recording you say "a fur fag" doing the same thing, and then opening audacity and putting them together to make it sound like you said "I'm a fur fag"
[3/21/2015 1:30:06 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Which is audio splicing

[3/21/2015 3:32:48 PM] Mack: I was born and raised in North Dakota. Back when I was in HS, a group of us would research murders that occurred out in the county. We would then go out to find the scenes and film the exploration at night (this was about two years before Blair Witch) It was something to do while we got wasted on shitty beer and teenage bullshit. Eventually we ran out of places to go (ND = few people, few murders) and got really good at finding abandoned rural farmsteads by driving dirt roads and looking for the signs. Rut roads, deliberate tree groves, and old mailbox posts were common markers. We were out looking when we spotted a tree grove that was out of place (sure sign) and drove through the field and discovered an old (but not too old) house. It had padlocks on the outside doors that were knocked off pretty easily, we dispatched of them and entered the kitchen. There were six of us, all with flashlights, and we lit up the kitchen/dining area fairly easily. The table was the initial thing you noticed and it was strange because of how normal it looked. It was set for a meal and not a bowl was out of place. Only thing was, we'd been in dozens of these houses and place setttings were a first. Especially unbroken ones. As we investigated the area we found the fridge had the disgusting remnants of a full stock, and the cupboards were full of canned and dry foods. This was also a first. One guy found mail on the counter from early June 1978 and another found a creepy ass TV guide in the living room with UFO's on the cover. All the family photos were hanging up. Mom, Dad, Bro and Sis in their 1970's glory. Furniture was dusty, but in good condition. Closets were full. Everything was totally normal. Which was super abnormal. As we dug around the house, we all started to realize that this house had not been moved out of, it had been straight up abandoned. Imagine locking the door to your house and never coming back. That's the state this house was in. Complete unplanned departure. We went upstairs and split into three pairs to check out the three rooms. Ours was the closest and obviously it was the younger boys room, I can't describe what it looked like too well because almost right away from the hall, we heard the most fucking terrifying scream I've ever had the misfortune of hearing. We went running into the hallway and were all yelling questions at each other at the same time. After a few (really long) seconds the two screamers caught their breath and said "you have to go in and see." Walking down the hall and through the doorway, I prayed I wouldn't act like a pussy in front of my friends. I shouldn't have been concerned because the others were as scared as I was. The room itself opened up to the left of the doorframe and centered on the right side of the room was a queenish sized bed. Propped up on pillows, with the blanket drawn to the waist, arms on top of the blanket, and worst of all, head turned slightly so it was looking you straight in the eyes when you entered the room was a life sized porcelain doll. Snow white skin, jet black hair, cold dead eyes. The dead eyes lit up with our flashlights. Like she was waiting for us. If the head hadn't been turned I could excuse it, but it was turned. Ready for when we walked in. Ready for 20 years. Hasty fucking exits were made down the stairs and into the car. It was during the ride we started to get even more creeped out when we realized that even though the house had been abandoned, someone had taken the time to set up that goddamn doll. Not packing food, clothes, or family photos. Setting up the doll was one of the last things done in this house. We researched their names, but got nothing. No tragic car accident. No grisly massacre. No extended family. Just a tacky time-capsule in the middle of nowhere. We found out that the county had taken possession of the land for nonpayment of taxes, explaining the locks, but never tracked down anymore information on what happened to them. Or why they left that fucking doll.

He ended up sticking with it and his parents spent thousands on doctors who couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.

He still hasn't told them he was faking everything. "

[3/23/2015 8:22:47 PM] Mack: "U-Um.. Y-Yeah, listen, the other day I visited Bon Bon's sweet shop and let me tell you one thing."
>You leaned in her direction and started to whisper.
"She developed a type of candy, which is a lot better than anything you can find in the Sugarcube Corner, claws down."
>She fell slowly on the road, beneath her and began to laugh.
>"Oh Spike, don't be silly! Nothing beats a good cupcake or a doughnut, or a cake, or a pie or.." 
>You silenced her with a risen claw.
"Belive me, there is. I know the taste of everything the cakes have in thier shop and this candy is ten times better."
>"No!"
"Oh, yes."
>"No!"
"Erm.. yes."
>"No!"
>This was getting you nowhere.
>"Yes, you know Bon Bon was actually so nice, she gave me some of her secret candy, to enjoy them at home."
>Pinkie was super active again.
>"Oh, oh, oh let me try one, let me! Please, please, please!"
>You backed off a little. 
"Okay, okay, but not in here. Bon Bon would be really upset, if she saw me giving her special sweets, to her main business rival. We need to find someplace where nopony can see or hear us."
>You knew you had her now.
>There were too many things on the line for her.
>Mainly her professional pride and addiction to sweets.
>"Hey, let's go to my room in Sugarcube Corner! The cakes are out for the weekend with the babies and the shop is closed for today! Nopony will bother us there, for the whole day!"
>Perfect.
"Alright, let's go!"
>During your way there, she was talking all the bucking time, about how she's gonna guess Bon Bon's secret recipe, by the taste of the candy alone.
>She was really full of herself, eh?
>Finally, you found yourselves in her room.
>While you were looking for the "secret" candy in your backpack, Pinkie was busy hopping up and down on her bed.
>"Hurry up Spike, hurry, hurry, hurry!"
[3/23/2015 8:22:55 PM] Mack: >When you grabbed the confection in your claws at last, you let yourself do a little joke, you learned from Anon.
"I got it, so please hold your 'horses' Pinkie, you must be 'stable' to taste it."
>She was beside you, in a blink of an eye.
>"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"
>You threw the candy in the air and she catched it with her teeth.
"Remember you have to swallow it, to really admire its taste."
>"*Munch Okie munch, munch Dokie munch* Lokie!"
>You couldn't help but smile.
>You knew there was something special in what she was eating.
>Not the taste though.
>The candy was laced with a strong poison, you have found in Twilight's private laboratory this morning.
>Well, you hoped it was powerfull enough for an hyperactive earth pony like her.
>After all, the vial it was in, had a warning on it and a pony skull drawing.
>Munching it for some more time, Pinke finally ate the whole sweet "delicacy".
>Cleaning her teeth with her tongue, she turned to you.
>"I knew you were just joking Spike! This candy was actually, quite bitter and salty! Nothing like my sweet and delicious cupcakes! I really don't know how Bon Bon can..."
"Sorry to interupt you Pinkie, but before we start talking about the confection again, I have a question."
>Smiling widely, she was all ears.
"Why are you always pranking me, made jokes about me?! Why are you always on my case when you're around, showing others that they can push me over, with little to no consequences?!"
>She put her hoof on your shoulder.
>"Oh, Spike don't be sill.."
>You slapped her limb off of you.
"NO! Don't tell me I'm just some silly, baby dragon and that there is no harm in a joke!"
>She started to sway a little.
>"Spike cough I'm not trying to tell you, you're..."
>This time you put your clawed hand on her sholder.
"Pinkie, I don't give a buck, about what are you trying to tell me. You never listened to me, so this time I won't listen to you."
>Her mane started to deflate and her fur lost its shine.

[3/24/2015 10:31:07 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Q: This mod is stupid. None of the texts are funny and you're ruining the immersion of the game. 
A: First of all, that's not a question. Second of all, if you don't like this mod then just follow the simple uninstall process. Step 1: Go to Home Depot and buy a rope. Step 2: Tie rope into a noose. Step 3: Find a nice sturdy ceiling fan. Step 4: Finish the uninstallation process by uninstalling yourself.

A: F--k if I know. I'm a comedy wizard, not a miracle worker. Maybe you shouldn't drop $3000 on a gaming PC, f----t. Try running Internet Explorer and open up 25 tabs of hardcore gay porn. That should slow your processor down enough.

Our mighty republics will ever endure.
The Great Soviet Union will live through the ages.
The dream of a people their fortress secure.

Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.

Through days dark and stormy where Great Lenin lead us
Our eyes saw the bright sun of freedom above
And Stalin our leader with faith in the people,
Inspired us to build up the land that we love.

Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.

We fought for the future, destroyed the invaders,
And brought to our homeland the laurels of fame.
Our glory will live in the memory of nations
And all generations will honour her name.

Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.

[3/28/2015 10:34:24 PM | Edited 10:43:51 PM] Mack: Today I was asking my mom about any towels. I wanted to take a shower, she said I should go put them in the hamper so they get washed. I found two smaller ones soon, but after I was done talking to my mom, I closed the garage door and saw my brother, making some ramen for his weeaboo appetite. I said " Hi Austin " And he said " David thinks your life is sad because you don't have a girlfriend. " 


I asked him " Who is David? " and he said " this 18 year old guy he is my friend. He thinks your life is sad. "

I replied with " Well, why don't you go tell David to fuck off "
He said  "...Okay then " and finished making his noodles.
I was angry, and tried thinking of that thing you wanted me to say. I came out of my room and told Austin that I was only 13 and I'm too young for that anyways and I don't remember what Austin said, but it was something along the lines of " No, whatever " 

I'm thinking now, What did Austin tell these people about me? Why does some random 18 year old on the internet know a lot about me?

Dude, I swear, If I go to highschool and have trouble making friends because of my brother.. Augh... I don't even know. If one of them says " Well, that's not what your brother said... " I will go " Okay. " and then kick my brother's ass. I do have a better idea though, than violence. Maybe deleting system32 for him, fucking with his tablet, all the good smart stuff I can do.
[3/28/2015 10:34:50 PM] Mack: I just think Austin and his little clique should keep their noses the fuck away from me and my business
[3/28/2015 10:39:54 PM] Mack: So what do you think?
[3/28/2015 10:43:15 PM] Mack: I just told my brother to stop talking trash
[3/28/2015 10:43:18 PM] Mack: He slammed the door
[3/28/2015 10:43:22 PM] Mack: And pushed my into my room

[3/28/2015 11:45:07 PM] Mack: I've decided to do something. An experiment. Instead of getting revenge, I am trying to be nice. I gave my brother some pizza ( The last slice actually ) and talked to him about WoW. ( He plays it a lot ) 

I think this is the best way for him not to ruin my rep, because he doesn't have anything bad to say.
[3/29/2015 1:50:51 AM] Mack: So I am learning about League
[3/29/2015 1:51:02 AM] Mack: It is bigger than Dota

[3/29/2015 1:51:43 AM] Mack: Build up your character, when you feel ready, take on an actual player. Kill all Nexus ( things that spawn Minions for the enemy player ) Be careful around turrets, etc
[3/29/2015 1:51:46 AM] Mack: it seems really tactile

[3/30/2015 6:12:20 AM] Mack: This is not good... I'm not proud of this. I once made a family of one adult white male, one black teen and two black children. One male one female.
I made them all deathly afraid of water several times over and began my experiments in my custom built lab in the mountains. The children were in the basement and lived in half a cell with only a toilet. On the other half was a fridge of food, however a pool of water lay between. If they could get over their fears then they win and get to feed, but must cross again to use the toilet.
The teenager lived in the backyard in the middle circle island of many circular pools ( think a target). With increasingly desirable treats on the outermost rings.
My scientist would watch from above and take notes.
Once the services came for the kids so I locked her in the experiments as well. She performed greatly.
I think we can all learn something about ourselves by playing the Sims.
I don't pay the Sims any more.
[3/30/2015 6:13:31 AM] Mack: I think I lost The Sims once.
I had a lovely family. A man, his wife, and one beautiful baby girl. They lived a blissful middle-class life in a suburban two-story home - wealthy enough to hire a nanny, but not wealthy enough that they could stop working.
One day, while the baby was left at home with the nanny, a fire started. The nanny was heating up a bottle of milk and forgot about it. By the time they got home, the whole house was in flames - and nanny and baby both were gone.
The ensuing weeks were trying. Their home was haunted by the spirit of their departed child. Every time they walked by the kitchen they'd see her and weep.
The loss of their child forced husband and wife to realize how estranged they had become. Every conversation was an argument or an insult.
And then, one day, he hit her.
I intervened on their free will to kick him out of the house after that. She had suffered too much. She would have to create a new life now, away from this haunted home and its painful memories.
And so she moved into a small bungalow in the country. But she was an old woman now, with nothing left to do but pass the time while she waited to join her daughter.
Every day, she would crawl out of bed to make breakfast. But on the way she would stop. She would think of the child she'd lost, or the husband who had left her, and she would break down and cry. By the time she recovered, she would have forgotten what it was she'd ever intended to do in the first place.
I don't know if you can lose The Sims, but that's gotta come close.

[3/30/2015 5:36:48 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: OK, this is fun.
My 7th grade girlfriend she tracked me down on facebook recently and we decided to get together. I hadn't heard from her in, like, 17 years but we decided to meet up for coffee.
So we sit down, we got our coffee and I said to her, "I'm sorry your cat died."
She looks at me and she's like, "What?" and I'm like, "Your cat. You know, your cat? I'm sorry she died." My girlfriend's like, "Why... why are you saying this?" so I'm like, "OK, well let's do the math here. Last time I saw you your cat I think was 12. It's been 17 years. So you're telling me your cat is still alive and she's 29? No your not telling me that. The cat's dead. I'm sorry that she's dead."
So then my girlfriend's like, "Why are you bringing this up? Of course my cat's dead. She died like 14 years ago." and I'm like, "Hey you know what - FUCK YOU."
[3/30/2015 5:42:20 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: I alone have probably logged 500 hours on dating sims alone and that's not even counting hentai. What's amazing is that the first dating sim I ever played was only 3mb but gave me the most erotic day of my life, it was the fact that you really felt you earned the sex and were directly engaged with the women instead of just a passive observer that did it for me. You really do need walkthroughs to get the good endings though, after I anally raped the female security guard with a taser to get the passcode to save my crush and I'm anticipating a hot night of "my hero!" sex the two younger sisters, your teacher and a couple of random skanks run up all pregnant and shit and ask if you're going to marry them and the older sister gets mad and runs away. Turns out you needed to wear a condom, already jerked off 6 times already but was more than willing to give it another playthrough.
So worth it, you do actually get to have sex with your true love but she cries and just lies there, but in the good ending she's a total nymph and you both orgasm many times before collapsing in each others arms and feel at peace with the world. Sort of night where you wake up to Claire De Lune.
Then there's Bible Black, holy fuck do you need a walkthrough to get the good endings there, one minor dialogue choice can fuck you over. Some of the bad endings are fucking hot though, like when you don't save the school and you get to see them get fucked by 80 guys before she pulls open her loose holes and says "wanna give it a go honey" and when you do she stabs you with poison. Or when your classmate ends up passed out in the hospital cause you misused black magic, and after you pull back the sheet and find her naked you jack off all over her body and just leave instead of wiping up she seduces you on the roof, then jams a cutip down your cock and fucks you till you die.
Best game is True Love story though, it's an rpg where you level up stats like sports to get the athletic girl, art to get the arty girl etc, and actually take them out on dates and force yourself too make up your mind. there's no enemas or tentacles or any of that good stuff, . You really take hours to develop a relationship with a girl and agonize over whether your actions will impress her and you start to blush whenever you have a random encounter with her and when you do make love it feels like the culmination of something beautiful. It's the closest approximation of how a real romantic and sexual relationship develops I have ever seen in a dating sim.
[3/30/2015 5:47:48 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: what is lasanya
[3/30/2015 5:50:35 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: There was this kid in my high school who was one of those "ambiguously retarded" kids. He had vaguely elfish features and eyes that pointed in radically different directions, but that wasn't what made us unsure. See, he'd come up and talk to you as though you'd been having a conversation for quite a while; he'd just start talking, not just mid-sentence, but sometimes mid-word. He would come into our physics class and talk to our teacher for like twenty minutes about, like, flight simulators or monster trucks or whatever, and then he would just abruptly leave. He has never had my physics teacher for any class and the teacher didn't even know his name.
Now, my friends and I had this theory. The theory was that he had no mental health issues at all and was simply a comic genius way ahead of his time, like Andy Kaufman. So that's what we called him. And so we started watching Andy Kaufman and were continually amazed at his power to make the world around him make less sense. He once dove to catch a taco that someone had thrown at a football game. We didn't see anyone throw it; we just saw him go "I'VE GOT IT!" and dive to the ground. Then he came up with a taco in his hand.
I tell you all that to tell you this story:
I was driving my friend home from school one day. He was in the passenger's seat and my other friend was in the back. It's a pretty routine drive, we're just talking about music and making dick jokes or whatever. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I see someone riding a bicycle in what may be the weirdest way I've seen someone do anything mundane. The best way I can describe it is like those bobbing birds that have liquid in them. While he was pedaling, he bobbed not just his head, but his entire upper torso up and down and up and down like someone at a black metal concert slowed down 50%. The best part, though, was that, trailing behind the bike, he had one of those rolling baby tents that dads use when they want to go biking but also have to watch the baby.
It was Andy Motherfucking Kaufman. This was huge for us, because we had never seen him outside of school and weren't entirely convinced he existed in the real world. But here he was, still being just weird enough to make us question reality without being totally over-the-top and outrageous.
And then he stopped.
We were intrigued, so we pulled into the parking lot of the bank in front of which he had stopped. And then we watched as he performed what we can now only see as wizardry. We watched and commented as this event unfolded.
He got off the bike.
What's he doing?
He walked into the middle of the bank's lawn.
Seriously, what is happening here?
He bent down.
Is he, like adjusting his shoe or something?
And then, out of a patch of grass not tall enough to conceal it, he pulled a GOD DAMNED SHOP-VAC. From nowhere. There was no place it could have been hidden. He then put it into the baby-tent trailer and rode away as if nothing had happened.
Did you guys all just see that? Did that happen in real life?
There was no Shop-Vac before he bent down to pick it up. As far as we know, he was riding along, saw the patch of grass in front of the bank, thought this will be a perfect place to summon a cleaning appliance, did so just because he could, and then rode on. My friends and I checked the spot. There is no way it could have concealed anything larger than a small clock radio, which I had in my car for some reason.

Get on a rape bus; screw us, screw us
Yeah, KKK, nigger babies i don’t give a fuck
Stick it up the butt

Dare I not see at your ripe cherry pussy
Bang every porch monkey easily, busily
Recently niggers fronting ain’t saying nothing
My cock nigger
Suck it, Triple K mafia, we’re on it

Hook [2x]
Moon man, Moon man, can’t you see
Spics and niggers need to hang from trees
And I just love your racist ways
I guess that’s why their mom is black and you’re so great

I put niggers underground without a sound
You minorities can’t step to me
All spics need to go back to Mexico
Never to be stealing money from you and me

Now who’s the real dookie
All you niggers smell like shit
You niggers can ride my dick
Spear chuckers pushing up sticks
Ooga booga, go back to Africa

I don’t know why I hate blacks
Oh yeah, it’s because they look
And smell like ass

Quit throwing your chicken bones on the sidewalk
Spics need to learn some English talk

I don’t give a fuck about your mama
Jizzing on her face ain’t no drama
It’s probably different than the nigger cock she’s used to
Kill a nigger and skullfuck a jew

Hook [2x]
Moon man, Moon man, can’t you see
Spics and niggers need to hang from trees
And I just love your racist ways
I guess that’s why their mom is black and you’re so great

[Sunman]
Everything you be saying is offensive to me
As a proud African American I would have used my right to free speech
Moon Man you need to stop the hate
After all we are one universal race

Fuck off nigger
I don’t give a fuck about people of other colors
Get the fuck out you ain’t my brother
Why don’t you go and fuck a hyena
When it’s dark outside I can’t even see ya

Hook [2x]
Moon man, Moon man, can’t you see
Spics and niggers need to hang from trees
And I just love your racist ways
I guess that’s why their mom is black and you’re so great

This is Moon man here telling you niggers to take a long walk off a short pier
Vote 5, faggots, and I’m out of here

[4/1/2015 10:33:12 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Contrary to popular belief, I didn’t get hacked, sniffed and/or doxed. As you have probably already noticed, the IP address going around that supposed to be mine is not (like I’m dumb enough to go on an IRC chat server with my own IP). The old man/ family that you trolls are harassing has nothing to do with me or the True Capitalist Radio show, so better luck next time (haha). But this little incident showed me something; that its time to end the TCR broadcast completely.

Ever since I began the show, I have never made any kind of substantial profit. So the main reason I conducted the broadcast was to deliver information, knowledge and news in a way that was unforgettable. Every show I conducted, I gave everything had! And I feel that show Podcasts of the show proves it.

But after this latest suppose “doxing” attempt :D, it was the proof I needed to show me that all the time, effort and energy was for not. After 4 years of broadcasting for free and bringing consistent rich content, I feel somewhat betrayed by those who claim to appreciate my work. I couldn’t help but notice all the evil satisfaction from those who felt they had identified me, and that is something I can not forget.

So I shall no longer put my health at risk and continue to broadcast (for free) to those who wish to see my misfortune. After February, there will be no more LIVE shows on True Capitalist Radio. To those True Fans that are extremely disappointed, I sincerely apologize from the bottom of my heart. It’s a few bad apples that rot the whole bunch.

And I understand that these “bad apples” are but a few losers amongst the entire TCR fan base. But these losers have not only attempted this “doxing” with me, but they have “doxed” many of my fans for one reason or another. These idiots must have a taste of their own medicine.

So I’ll make a deal with you! If someone (anyone) can legitimately own these culprits behind this BS (and you all know who they are), I’ll come back and do live shows again. But not until something is done to those pathetic no life having idiots who are not only trying to dox me, but also the TCR fans. So for all you trolls that want to become a legend, this is a call to you (I'll make you a co-host for a month)! I shall be lurking and if these dogs get their day; then I shall return.

He approached Andy which startled him and make him pee everywhere on the floor and on Woody too. Being drenched in his urine made him harder than ever! Woody: "Andy Senpai! I'm alive and I want to be INSIDE OF YOU." Andy: "Oh Woody Chan! I always knew you were alive! I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!" Woody grabbed a bunch of flavored live and rubbed it all over is head Woody: "Oh my! It's cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite! Woody then stuffed his head up into Andy's tight ass! The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise. The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate. Andy: "Oh my goodness, Woody Chan! You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES! All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice round ass. Andy: "No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full! All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having his insides completely damaged. The mother came inside and found Andy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of toys.

It's 2015.  ​Many people think you're dead.  I have been listening to your broadcasts over and over for a very long time.  Listening to your advice, and learning the ways of a capitalist.  I am more than thankful for you having done this, knowing how much money you've spent on the show, you said in the pal-talk radio.  or another guy estimated...  Either way, it's a lot.  you've been doing that for 4 or 5 years, and it was great.  The trolls ruined it.  Like you said, a few bad apples spoiled the bunch.  I've read your blog, and all that.  Those doxxing retards will probably never get their day.  It's been 4 years.  4 years ghost.  They're long gone by now.  Like you.  The only remnants left of you is the wiki, run by a few great people, and your archives on  btr.  I've been downloading all of your shows, so I can share your advice with friends.  Anyways, the point of this letter was to see if you still exist.  If this email still exists.  I know, it would probably never happen, but if you could come back, under a different name, or even get on the pal-talk for Christ's sake, many people would be forever grateful.  You've announced the end.  Now I think it's high time to announce the beginning. A new beginning.  When the dogs get their day, you said.  If the dogs get their day, it will be a great day indeed.  If you do decide to reply to this, then I know you still care.  You still exist.  If you've passed away, nobody would have known up here on the internet.  Please, ghost.  Please. Come back.  We need you.  I need you.

Sorry if any of that sounded fruity.

[4/4/2015 11:39:30 PM] Mack: I didn't know what to do, my ears were plugged because the 20 gauge was loud. I yelled and they just said fire. my job was to shoot at the little bags and basket balls in there to scare out the mice. I tried to hit the one mouse, but I only winged it, and it got away. After a while of shooting the bags, A ton started to come out and my dad and JR ( Dad's friend ) shot a lot. I went over to the side to see and there was a huge rat. JR went to scare them out, I held the light and my dad shot the mice. He killed 4 and shot 5 times. One got away, and the fifth shot was to put one out of it's misery. I didn't see any blood, and I only think I wounded one. If I did wound it, it is dead now

What the fuck do you get out of all this? Nobody fucking likes you, please just go the fuck away. Up yours buddy.

I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" Banana guy, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE." You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.

[4/28/2015 7:48:25 PM] Mack: I used to assist in piercings and suspensions at a shop my friend owned. A guy comes in for a guiche piercing. He is in a suit and tie. Not out of the ordinary. At that shop there was ton of under the suit piercing and tattoo people that came in. So for the guiche you have to get on your elbows and knees and more or less "present". He takes off his clothes and is wearing bondage clamps on his nipples. still not that odd. He gets into position and I go to clean and sterilize the area while the piercer is setting up all the hardware. It may seem obvious to everyone reading this as it was to me, but our customer hadn't thought to remove his massive butt-plug during undressing. Starting to be odd as I have never knowingly had anyone gettting/wanting to get pierced while wearing a butt-plug. He removes it. I get him cleaned. The piercer clamps him and he squeaks, we exchange a little question glance, needle goes, different squeak, jewelry goes in and he moans. He gets up off the table, butt-plug right back in, and goes about getting dressed. I go to prep the table and he has came ALL OVER the table. Peter North status. KAAAAaaaaaa-BOOOOOOOM. He gets dressed, pays well and tips well, and goes out the door. He came back every year to have it stretched and did the same thing except he remembered to take the butt-plug out during his undressing on subsequent visits.

[4/30/2015 4:06:01 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.
John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said "its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences" so he had to go.
John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.
The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said "its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys".
John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.
"I cant give you my lisense officer" John Freeman said
"Why not?" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.
"Because you are headcrab zombie" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking "my brother is in trouble there" and went faster.
John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw "Ravenholm" with someons writing under it saying "u shudnt come here" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.
John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.
John Freeman said "Zombie goasts leave this place" and the zombie goasts said "but this is our house" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.
Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.
When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said "John Freeman! Over here!" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.
Gordon Freeman said "its time to end this ones and for all!" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said "thanks i could help, bro" and Gordon Freeman said "you should come here earlier next time" and they laughed.
The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled "LOOK OUT BRO!" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said "NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!" and John Freeman walked real fast out.
John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.
"I'll get you back evil boss!" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.
[4/30/2015 4:08:34 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: John Freeman walked like speed of light back to his motorcycl and left behind the bad place behind him. John Freeman had to ride his motorcycle really fast back to the office but John Freemans gas ran out. John Freeman jumped fast off the motorcycle and landed on dead peoples hands.

"Gordon Freeman is now these hands... i must kill the next boss and live up to full-life consequences!" John Freeman said out loud.

John Freeman picked up a laser gun and aimed it at trees to see if he could. John Freeman shot and tree fell down in front of him. John Freeman seen eggs fall out of the tree and he put them back home safe.

"These birds dont have to see Gordon Freeman yet. its not time." John Freeman said to him.

John Freeman had to walked faster and was back at his office work and on a computer. He looked on the internet and found the next boss.

"I know his weakness now" John Freeman said. And after that he got emails from someone. John Freeman opened up the emails and read them.

"Dear John Freeman, how are you? I miss you at home come home safe and soon with Gordon Freeman for thanksgiving dinner. Love mom." John Freeman looked at it and got sad and yelled "I WILL KILL THE BOSS AND GORDON FREEMAN WILL BE HAPPY SOUL!" then he turned on off the computer and wet on the platform again down to his other more faster motorcycle that had gas in it this time.

John Freeman put the laser gun on his motorcycle and his machine gun and his rocket gun that he found on the side of the motorcycle. He went through traffic and went fast like litning to back to Ravenholm and back to the bad place where Gordon Freeman was. John Freeman went off road and did backflips and landed on back wheels but kept going too.

John Freeman went really fast again like before and was soon back again at Ravenholm but saw more zombie goasts. John Freeman said to them "Zombie goasts i have killed your friends at the old house and i dont want to shoot your heads. move near the countrysides and you will be friends of John Freeman." The zombie goasts said that "no we will kill you" and walked fast to John Freemans motorcycle. John Freeman waited until they were in front of his motorcycle and backflipped off his bars and shot heads below and landed and walked fast to where the next boss was.

"you will be one of us!" yelled the dead zombie goasts. John Freeman laughed and shot a rocket at them.

John Freeman saw the next boss far down the road and walked slow this time. He walked really slow like a turtle and sat down on a rock and watched the next boss near the dead last boss and where the place that Gordon Freeman was. The next boss was laughing at John Freeman so John Freeman said "YOU WILL NOT LAUGH AT ME!" and shot a rocket at him since that was his weakness.

The next boss died and John Freeman was happy. He walked over to the dead bosses and put them under the ground and planted pants on them so instead of messy dirt and dark there was pretty things there now to be happy.

John Freeman walked to where Gordon Freeman was lying dead and crushed from the next bosss feet and looked down. A tear droped out of John Freemans eye and landed on Gordon Freeman.

"You are dead bro and i killed the evil boss." John Freeman told Gordon Freeman

Then John Freeman saw something bad. A headcrab was on Gordon Freeman! Gordon Freeman standed up and said "John Freeman... you got here slow and now i am zombie goast. you will pay..."

[5/9/2015 5:04:45 PM] Mack: HUGE FUCKING STORM
[5/9/2015 5:22:19 PM] Mack: If you model how many ancestors you have in each generation, it follows the function 2n, with n being the number of generations. So 0 generations back is 1, which is you. 1 generation back you have 2 parents, 2 back you have 4 grandparents, etc.
Now if you go back 40 generations to the year 700 or so, you have over 1 trillion ancestors. But there weren't 1 trillion people even alive then. So every person alive then would show up on your family tree like 10,000 times.
[5/9/2015 5:52:14 PM] Mack: Twitter is duplicated in the US Library of Congress, and even Reddit is preserved in the Internet Archive. It's entirely possible that those things will be stored for hundreds of years, as historical artifacts, ways for historians to see how ordinary people reacted to major events (9/11, the Indonesian Tsunami, the Arab Spring, etc), to capture how we spoke and what our culture was like. In the year 2345, a history student might be reading this conversation we're having right now. They won't know your name or anything about you, but the fact that Blue Dog Democracy was shaken by the thought of nothing remaining of him will be sitting there in the archives, and the student will think "Heh, if he only knew."
Hello from ye olde 2015, people of the distant future poking around on the internet archives. I hope there hasn't been a nuclear war yet, and that the X-Files revival was good. That was a TV show. You should check it out, they might have a copy of it in the Art History Museum.

[5/14/2015 7:11:07 AM] Mack: (n)spoopy(2+n)me
[5/14/2015 7:26:12 AM] Mack: i just recently broke my habit with CSGO. My friend had introduced me to it during the Op Bravo era. I was terrible at the game and only played against bots for a while. I remember when I finally worked up the courage to play competitive. The first time I clutched a round I was amazed. I had never felt something so exciting before in a game. So I would start putting CSGO in front of other games. Instead of playing AoE with my bro I would instead boot up CSGO so I could DM to get my aim better and learn the maps faster.
Next thing I know I'm craving playing more competitive on my next days off. So all I do at work is read about csgo on reddit and watch youtube tutorials and videos. It begins to dictate my conversations with friends and even my wife. At this point the crates and skins come into play. I would only open a case if I got in a drop and would usually only open it with friends (just for fun). Next thing I now I was looking at my next car payment due and thought, "i got $30 bucks extra left, might as well open crates. who knows maybe i'll make profit and get a knife."
Well if you didn't guess it, it became a huge problem. To the point where my wife had to bail me out a few times to help cover my part of the bills. Bless her soul, she knew this entire time what I was doing but I always made up stories about how I wasn't sure where the money was going or it was because I was buying us too much food when we'd go out. I would get irrational and angry easily at her about money (secretly I knew it was my fault, but I didn't want to admit that).
At this point I was playing CSGO ~8-12 hours every night I had off and would constantly think about it when I was at work, on a date, or with family. I was heavily addicted and too stubborn to admit it to myself. Saying I was just having fun and could stop anytime I wanted to. I stopped going out and stopped worrying about social standards. All I worried about was my MM rank and my precious skins.
One day I guess I got lucky and unboxed 2 expensive knives within a few days (still way negative on money, but the addict in me didn't care). I had roughly ~1000 dollars worth of digital items and didn't know what to do. I had some many ideas on what to do with them and it was just burning holes in my paypal.
I can't tell you what made me stop playing. It wasn't a single decision or a day that I just quit. I just remember one weekend me and my wife decided to go fishing at a local pond. We ended up having an awesome time (she had never been fishing before) and catching a lot of fish. When were finishing up that night I had realized that I had went that entire afternoon without thinking about CSGO. I got home and booted it up like I normally would and just "wasn't feeling it". So I cuddled my wife instead and watched a movie with her. Slowly but surely I stopped craving the feeling. I sold all my skins for paypal money and bought us more fishing gear and transferred money to my savings. I still think about the game every once and a while. But I don't really miss it now. It's like being able to look through a doorway and see a different you. I was a person that I don't want to be again. CSGO is fun but it can easily become an addiction that is hard to handle. And it looks harmless because "it's just a video game".
If you're wondering: yes I still play video games (GTAV mainly). But I'm not stuck in front of my computer constantly like I was. It's hard sometimes to not go back to CSGO (it's pretty recent that I've kicked the habit.) but I keep reminding myself that I don't need it. I've replaced it as a bad habit with better habits. Been trying to work out more, go fishing more(super fun way to get outside) and my mind is racing with more fun things to do outside with my wife.
I know I've rambled a lot here. But it's something I've needed to get off my chest. I had an addiction and it wasn't drugs or alcohol. It was CSGO. Luckily with the support of my amazing wife I am recovering from that addiction and finding a new light in life (cheesy but true). You can play video games without being addicted, you just gotta know when too much is too much.

[4:26:13 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[4:48:18 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: I really fucked up here a few weeks ago. This may seem very similar to that TIFU where the guy supposedly "hacked" the school computer, but it's kinda different.
It all starts with me being assigned a paper on the history of computers. Last year I did a fucking 5 page essay on how a computer worked and I think that's what got me into this class. I get to the lab at my school (we have 25 chromebooks, and 20 Windows computers), and naturally I take the Windows computer because I'm more familiar with that.
I like to get head starts on all my essays and projects, which I already did, and pull out my trusty flash drive. I do have a load of personal stuff on there (no, not porn) such as documents for other things and programs I use at home. One of those programs, let's say, is called Fake Virus. A bit of backstory to this, I pranked a friend with it once, and I never deleted it. Also, our teachers say the computers are watched, which I highly doubted (not anymore).
So anyways, I loaded up the flash drive and temporarily copied my essay onto the computer. Now, as I am paranoid about someone stealing my data and shit (thanks, /u/Michaelscot8 (the guy who made the Ubuntu on a school computer thing)), so I have it encrypted with a password. I know anybody who is viewing the computer could not access it without the password. BUT, once the password is entered, it is open to whoever views the computer, until you close it, which resets it.
It was about 4:30 now and I decided I should probably get home soon. I pack up, but the forgetful person I am, I forget the flash drive. The files on there are currently open to whoever uses the computer. The overseer of the lab had left just 10 minutes earlier, so there was nobody to log the computers out.
Fast forward to next day, I get a call during the ride to school to meet the principal in the office as soon as I get there. I think "what the fuck have I done now? I swear everything i go in for is complete and utter bullshit." I get to school, and go straight to his office. I sit down and wait to get fucking scolded. Worst feeling of your life right here. And he fucking scolds me about the Fake Virus program.
I try to explain to him that it was a prank to my friend and he proceeds to become so ignorant by saying "WHAT YOU DID WAS ILLEGAL? DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? ILLEGAL. I-L-L-E-G-A-L." He spells it out for me and in my head I am like: "who the fuck does this person think he is. I'm not a brain dead unlike him." When he is finished rambling and ranting about how this is illegal and he's gonna call the police, he proceeds to get the fucking IT guy. I get a bit more calm because I know the IT team at this school is a piece of shit and can't fix anything.
Of course, the shitty IT man turns into a pretentious shit storm and says something along the lines of "Okay. I will break the code of the malware that this student has and I will report to you once I have the illegal code at hand. Please bear with me that I will try my hardest to fetch the code for you, and make sure that the evidence is enough to send him into the juvenile detention center." Bitch what? You're talking about me going to the juvenile detention center for a fucking Notepad script that pops up 4 fucking windows of text and a Yes or No button.
By now, the principal is calmed down enough, but as soon as I open my mouth he acts like he is a police officer reading me my Miranda Rights. "You have the right to remain silent." and blah blah blah. Yeah you can go fuck yourself Mr. Hothead. My day continued with a 7 day in-school suspension while the "IT" man figured out the program.
And it get's more extreme. My father is an actual IT, and my mother as a technician at a software production place, and they didn't like me getting in trouble for some useless program. Of course, they discussed the issue with me, but they are pretty pissed at this point. They proceed to drive to the Superintendents Office and complain with all their fucking might.
So, after my in-school suspension and no word on the punishment, I get another in-school suspension while waiting on it. My parents can get super angry, which they were. They have threatened to press charges on the Principal, the whole school (possibly the district), and the IT man who took the drive.
Also, no word if I am going to get the drive back anytime soon, but I imagine that he is having problems getting into the drive. Heh heh heh.
But other than me being super pissed off, I am happy that my parents may take proper action. We also have a couple of other parents taking action as well, but I really don't know how far this will go. I'll try to update you all every day. I am expected to get a call from the Superintendent tonight, and I will surely post an update on that sometime later.
TL;DR: Had a program called Fake Virus on my flashdrive, had to go (and still going) through a shit storm.
Thanks for the support if given!
UPDATE 1: I forgot to put quotation marks around the word "breaking" in the title. Anyways, just got the call and they're not happy. The superintendent says that I am in the midst of an expulsion. I'm not falling for it. If they do expel me, the schools going to go through a shit storm of angry computer-literate kids and parents, and probably many charges filed against them. Also, they are locked out of my flash drive, so tomorrow they want me to unlock it for them. Scratch the word "want". Put "forcing" instead. There's my rights violated. What is privacy? Something ducks walk on? More updates to come in the meanwhile.
UPDATE 2: Second one for the day/night. My lawyer will be speaking with the superintendent and principal, I hope everything goes well.

[6/8/2015 8:15:30 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Gimme gimme chicken tendies,
Be they crispy or from Wendys.
Spend my hard-earned good-boy points,
on Kid's Meal ball pit burger joints.
Mummy lifts me to the car,
To find me tendies near and far.
Enjoy my tasty tendie treats,
in comfy big boy booster seats.
McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's,
But of my tendies none remains.

She tries to make me take a nappy,
But sleeping doesn't make me happy.
Tendies are the only food,
That puts me in the napping mood.
I'll scream and shout and make a fuss,
I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss!
Tendies are my heart's desire,
Fueled by raging, hungry fire.
Mummy sobs and wails and cries,
But tears aren't tendies, nugs or fries.

My good-boy points were fairly earned,
To buy the tendies that I've yearned.
But there's no tendies on my plate!
Did mummy think that I'd just ate?
"TENDIES TENDIES GET THEM NOW,
YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW!"
I screech while hurling into her eyes,
My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise.
For she who is un-pooped on is she who remembers:
Never forget my chicken tenders.
[6/8/2015 8:15:55 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Jesus said to the money lenders
Don't be dealing chicken tenders
God will fry your ass to embers

[6/12/2015 2:09:55 PM] Mack: When I was 12, my parents separated. Things had always been nasty between them so I was glad that my mom had kicked my dad out. A few days later, my dad showed up at my middle school to pick my sister and me up (this was before schools were crazy strict about who kids left with). He said that he had talked to our mom and she told him it was okay to pick us up and spend the evening with us. So we get into his pickup, and I immediately notice that his shotgun is hanging on the rack of the back window (I used to go hunting with him, so I knew it was off season and that it was weird for the gun to be there). He calls our mom a little ways into the drive and says "I've got the girls. I'll bring them home when I can come too. If not, tough shit." He hung up. She called and called and he eventually turned his phone off. My mom said she called the police but because they were still legally married with no custody arrangement, there was nothing they could do. My dad ended up taking us to his mom's house. I remember him crying and asking if I would choose him in the divorce. I said no, I wanted to stay with my mom, and he starts throwing his head against the wall! The wall is dented and bloody, and he's got a couple knots swelling on his forehead. He said "see, this is what you make me do. You don't wanna make this any harder on me, do you sweetheart?" Just thinking about that now makes me sick to my stomach. So we're there for a couple days, my mom came and knocked on the door. My dad called the cops on her for trespassing so she had to leave. Another day or two go by, and he finally says he'll take me to Lowe's (where my mom worked at the time) to see her and say hi. We walk in, start going down the lumber aisle, and I see my mom towards the back. She's sees me and drops to her knees, crying, and throws her arms out for me. I start running and make it to her for about half a second before he ripped me away again. He had a hold of my left hand, barely, fingernails digging in, and was dragging me back out of the store. I still have little scars on the back of my hand from him. I could see my mom chasing after us screaming "someone please help! He's got my baby! That's my little girl!" So he throws me back in the truck and speeds out of there and heads to the back/country roads. I was bawling and he just kept asking why I did it, why did I have to mess it up. We finally get back to his mom's house and there were a couple of cop cars there waiting. He finally gave up, and we got to go back to our mom. He never got in any kind of trouble for the whole thing, besides a nationwide ban from Lowe's. Just to continue the story a little further, my mom had filed for divorce during this time. Divorce takes 60 days from filing to be complete/official. Two days before it was final and over, my dad called my mom while she was at work, saying "please call this off. We can fix this and get through it. I love you, please," crying the whole time. She kept saying no, it's over. So he finally stops crying and says "so this is how you want things?" She said yes. "Okay then, bitch." About an hour and a half later, my mom gets another phonecall at work. This time, it's the fire department. Our house (we lived out in the country) was on fire, and no one had even seen it until the Schwan man drove by and called it in. Well by that time, it was a total loss. The fire marshall ruled it as arson, even saying it was a "lover's fire" or something because the fire had been started on or underneath their bed. I lost everything I ever had, minus a stuffed animal and the clothes on my back. He never got caught for that either. A few years ago, when he was fucked up on pills, he admitted to my half brother that he was behind it. Anniversary of the fire was actually yesterday; 14 years ago.

Use the best Skype experience on your computer
Hello waffleberryop

It looks like you’ve signed into two Skype for Windows apps ‒ Skype for Windows desktop and Skype for modern Windows ‒ on your Windows 8 device.

We’re simplifying your experience down to one app that you can use either with your mouse and keyboard or with touch. Going forward you’ll only need to use the Skype for Windows desktop app. This app has more features to help you stay connected like screen sharing and group video calling. Also, your chat conversations (from the last 30 days) and all your contacts will appear as normal.

Note: From 7 July, 2015 you’ll no longer be able to sign into the Skype for modern Windows app.
[6/19/2015 4:34:37 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: TL;DR uninstall the app in the start menu

THE PROPER TERM FOR "GAY" IS YAOI. Just because I'm eleven doesn't mean that I can't be a perv. I'm mature. I write yaoi fanfiction. I have many people who like my yaoi posts on fanfiction.net and deviantART. I read yaoi every day. Yaoi is my life. I couldn't live without yaoi. I would die without it. I know everything about yaoi sex. I'M NOT STUPID. I read my first doujinshi when I was ten. I'm NOT like the other kids, SO STOP SAYING THAT I AM. I'm sick of it. I'm so fucking sick of all of it. I'll have you know that I knew what a penis does when I was NINE FUCKING YEARS OLD. NINE. I WAS FUCKING NINE. I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A PENIS WAS WHEN YOU WERE NINE. I type with proper grammar, and you don't. You aren't better than me. You don't even use the right word for yaoi. It's not gay. Do your research. By the way, gay porn is disgusting. It's nothing like yaoi and it's unrealistic, and gross. The ukes are usually not even shorter than the seme. It's disgusting. Fuck all of you. I'm eleven and I'm not "stupid" because I actually know the origin of yaoi and you don't. Fuck you. Fuck off

Very recommend for someone who want to commit suicide but don't have enough of courage. Trust me, when you play this game, you will want to end your life as quick as you can. This is the most fearsome weapon that human ever created.

[6:10:39 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: he chooses a 'host' after every 9th day
[6:10:50 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: the brown
[6:11:17 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: it didn't take long for shit to heap up all over the vault.  some say it happened unnaturally fast, in fact.
[6:11:33 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: A tale started to spread throughout the vault of living, moving shit.
[6:11:43 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: as if the feces had itself become a sentient creature
[6:12:18 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: they were only tales, of course, but one time, after a shifting, one dweller saw a single skinny in a room filled to the brim with brown
[6:12:45 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: before blocking up the hole on that side of the room, the dweller watched for a while, it was covered head to toe in shit
[6:12:47 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: it ate the shit
[6:12:52 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: it bathed in shit
[6:12:54 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: it was the shit
[6:13:03 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: then it started moving
[6:13:18 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: there was never a skinny as intellegent as the brown (save for the snatcher)
[6:13:39 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: it moved the shit via suction tube made of human intestines
[6:14:07 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: when all the shit had been emptied, the brown wrote on the wall.  a message in it's precious shit
[6:14:14 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: PAYMENT IN BROWN, TO SAVE YOUR LIFE
[6:14:41 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: the dwellers surrounding quickly dropped a shit right then and there, into the cell
[6:14:47 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: except for one.
[6:15:07 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: a few hours later, a harrowing scream came from the man's vault.
[6:15:20 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: masters of decay
[6:15:41 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: a cult begins in the vault that embraces the spreading disease, believing it's the only way to escape the vault
[6:16:01 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: they shit in piss in other people's rooms too, but now they keep screaming and yelling about the diseases they're spreading
[6:16:27 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: brotherhood of cleanliness
[6:16:36 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: they are basically the opposite of the masters of decay
[6:17:02 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: they go around offering bits of soap and cleaning supplies to each other to fend off disease.
[6:17:36 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: corpse rooms
[6:18:19 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: when someone dies, the body does not get taken away.  it stays in the room.  these rooms become 'corpse rooms' where people throw chopped up parts from dead bodies, babies, and shit.
[6:20:18 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: a lot of time went into this
[6:20:21 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: read it
[6:42:40 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: I made a quick map of a cell
[6:43:52 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: the kitchen contains most useful shit like cooking things, utensils such as silverware, food/clothing extrusion, and first aid.
[6:44:48 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: The maintanance area includes things like tools(hammers wrenches, etc.),  extra metal bits and scrap wood
[6:45:45 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: The ? area is a random setup possibly including bit not limited to, a tv, bookcase, desk, chair, tables, books, music, vidya, a pc, etc
[6:46:19 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: no tools or equipment is capable of damaging the walls in any way, expecially the holes, which have been reinforced to prevent widening.
[6:46:32 AM | Edited 6:46:36 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: about 1px = 1cm^2
[6:46:46 AM | Edited 6:46:58 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: all rooms are about 7 ft tall

[6/28/2015 11:26:08 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥:  I was not raised in a racist home or environment. Living in the South, almost every White person has a small amount of racial awareness, simply beause of the numbers of negroes in this part of the country. But it is a superficial awareness. Growing up, in school, the White and black kids would make racial jokes toward each other, but all they were were jokes. Me and White friends would sometimes would watch things that would make us think that “blacks were the real racists” and other elementary thoughts like this, but there was no real understanding behind it. 

 The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words “black on White crime” into Google, and I have never been the same since that day. The first website I came to was the Council of Conservative Citizens. There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on White murders. I was in disbelief. At this moment I realized that something was very wrong. How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case while hundreds of these black on White murders got ignored? 

 From this point I researched deeper and found out what was happening in Europe. I saw that the same things were happening in England and France, and in all the other Western European countries. Again I found myself in disbelief. As an American we are taught to accept living in the melting pot, and black and other minorities have just as much right to be here as we do, since we are all immigrants. But Europe is the homeland of White people, and in many ways the situation is even worse there. From here I found out about the Jewish problem and other issues facing our race, and I can say today that I am completely racially aware. 

      Blacks

 I think it is is fitting to start off with the group I have the most real life experience with, and the group that is the biggest problem for Americans.
 Niggers are stupid and violent. At the same time they have the capacity to be very slick. Black people view everything through a racial lense. Thats what racial awareness is, its viewing everything that happens through a racial lense. They are always thinking about the fact that they are black. This is part of the reason they get offended so easily, and think that some thing are intended to be racist towards them, even when a White person wouldnt be thinking about race. The other reason is the Jewish agitation of the black race. 
 Black people are racially aware almost from birth, but White people on average dont think about race in their daily lives. And this is our problem. We need to and have to. 
 Say you were to witness a dog being beat by a man. You are almost surely going to feel very sorry for that dog. But then say you were to witness a dog biting a man. You will most likely not feel the same pity you felt for the dog for the man. Why? Because dogs are lower than men. 
 This same analogy applies to black and White relations. Even today, blacks are subconsciously viewed by White people are lower beings. They are held to a lower standard in general. This is why they are able to get away with things like obnoxious behavior in public. Because it is expected of them. 
 Modern history classes instill a subconscious White superiority complex in Whites and an inferiority complex in blacks. This White superiority complex that comes from learning of how we dominated other peoples is also part of the problem I have just mentioned. But of course I dont deny that we are in fact superior. 
 I wish with a passion that niggers were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves, that segregation was an evil an oppressive institution, and so on. Because if it was all it true, it would make it so much easier for me to accept our current situation. But it isnt true. None of it is. We are told to accept what is happening to us because of ancestors wrong doing, but it is all based on historical lies, exaggerations and myths. I have tried endlessly to think of reasons we deserve this, and I have only came back more irritated because there are no reasons. 
 Only a fourth to a third of people in the South owned even one slave. Yet every White person is treated as if they had a slave owning ancestor. This applies to in the states where slavery never existed, as well as people whose families immigrated after slavery was abolished. I have read hundreds of slaves narratives from my state. And almost all of them were positive. One sticks out in my mind where an old ex-slave recounted how the day his mistress died was one of the saddest days of his life. And in many of these narratives the slaves told of how their masters didnt even allowing whipping on his plantation. 
 Segregation was not a bad thing. It was a defensive measure. Segregation did not exist to hold back negroes. It existed to protect us from them. And I mean that in multiple ways. Not only did it protect us from having to interact with them, and from being physically harmed by them, but it protected us from being brought down to their level. Integration has done nothing but bring Whites down to level of brute animals. The best example of this is obviously our school system.
 Now White parents are forced to move to the suburbs to send their children to “good schools”. But what constitutes a “good school”? The fact is that how good a school is considered directly corresponds to how White it is. I hate with a passion the whole idea of the suburbs. To me it represents nothing but scared White people running. Running because they are too weak, scared, and brainwashed to fight. Why should we have to flee the cities we created for the security of the suburbs? Why are the suburbs secure in the first place? Because they are White. The pathetic part is that these White people dont even admit to themselves why they are moving. They tell themselves it is for better schools or simply to live in a nicer neighborhood. But it is honestly just a way to escape niggers and other minorities. 
 But what about the White people that are left behind? What about the White children who, because of school zoning laws, are forced to go to a school that is 90 percent black? Do we really think that that White kid will be able to go one day without being picked on for being White, or called a “white boy”? And who is fighting for him? Who is fighting for these White people forced by economic circumstances to live among negroes? No one, but someone has to. 

 Here I would also like to touch on the idea of a Norhtwest Front. I think this idea is beyond stupid. Why should I for example, give up the beauty and history of my state to go to the Norhthwest? To me the whole idea just parralells the concept of White people running to the suburbs. The whole idea is pathetic and just another way to run from the problem without facing it. 
 Some people feel as though the South is beyond saving, that we have too many blacks here. To this I say look at history. The South had a higher ratio of blacks when we were holding them as slaves. Look at South Africa, and how such a small minority held the black in apartheid for years and years. Speaking of South Africa, if anyone thinks that think will eventually just change for the better, consider how in South Africa they have affirmative action for the black population that makes up 80 percent of the population. 
 It is far from being too late for America or Europe. I believe that even if we made up only 30 percent of the population we could take it back completely. But by no means should we wait any longer to take drastic action. 

 Anyone who thinks that White and black people look as different as we do on th...

[4:27:07 AM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: Ok, so here's some back story before we get into the disturbing stuff. I work for a call center that handles real estate agents. I'm pretty much a glorified assistant to agents. But to about 300 different agents a day. I schedule appointments to show homes for them, and I call home owners, tenants, and listing agents to get approval to show their homes. It's a pretty monotanous job, but it pays well enough, and I get to sit down instead of be on my feet for 8 hours. Sometimes though, the monotony is broken by some pretty odd or interesting home owners. Old folks that have had their home forever and can't use a cell phone or computer. Or disgruntled people who are about to foreclose with the bank and just want to swear and have you identify with them. They're all usually pretty funny, at least in retrospect. What I'm about to tell you about now is not one of those instances.
My day started out fine enough. Aside from an intensely humid walk to work, I was feeling pretty good. As hot as it was, it looked bright and colorful everywhere, and I was in a pretty good mood. Sat down, stuffed a meal bar down my throat, and started making calls. About an hour into my work day, I came across an appoinment for a listing here in Texas. It was for a house on a farm road, and the price was pretty high for that market. It'd been withdrawn from the market for years and it had only just come back up for sale about two days ago. And like a lot of agents, one real estate agent saw the price and picture (both were very nice), and probably without even going out there, scheduled a showing for one his buyers.
This property had a listing agent with no contact info. That already struck me as odd. Sometimes, an agent sneaks in without contact info by setting up online, but it's pretty rare. It's extremely rare for an agent like that to list a home. It should actually be impossible due to our company policy, but it happens. Usually only on listings that have been in our system since the beginning, much like this one. It made me hesitate, but when you have to make about 400 calls a day, you don't hesitate for long on anything. I checked the contacts list and there was one choice. It didn't have a name. Just said "Home". This is not as rare. Whether it's bad work ethic on our behalf, or a home owner who wants to remain annonymous, a lot of tenants and sellers don't list their names. I didn't think too much of it, and went to make the call.
I phoned the "Home" number for the house and it rang and rang. After about ten rings, I was ready to hang up and mark it as a "Did not Answer", but then I got the machine. It was the generic automated voice that answered. I hate those more than nearly any annoying seller. They take forever and they're so loud and robotic. Just a pet peev I guess.
"Hello. No one is available right now to take your call. Please leave message for ...", the automated voice drolled out the long phone number, as I motioned my hand in a hurried manner. Like I could somehow speed it up through my impatience.
Once the beep sounded, I began my usual shpeel, "Hi, this is Wayne with (my company), I'm calling about your home on (the address). I have an agent named (showing agent) who would like to show your home to a buyer today at--".
I was cut off. The phone clicked and I could instantly hear what I can only describe as old-timey, 30's music echoing through the home. It was accompied by a low slapping or thumping sound. Like someone was dancing very slowly and loudly by themselves. The sounds were soon accompanied by a heavy and anxious breathing right up against the phone on the other end.
"Hello, is this the homeowner for (address)?", I asked, already getting the creeps.
There was a chuckle and snort through the heavy breathing, then just more music, slapping, and heaving. I could tell it was a man's voice. Sounded like a big man.
"Hello, sir?", I asked again.
"Yeah.", A raspy voice said. Then nothing else aside from that disgusting breath gurgling up and down.
"Yes sir, I have a (agent) that would like to show your home between 12 and 1 today, would that be possible?", I asked, running through the words.
"They got buyers with 'em?", the voice asked.
Well no shit, I thought, but didn't say. "Yes sir."
"How many?", he almost interrupted me.
"I'm not sure, sir. At least one.", I answered. It caught me a bit off guard, I'd never had a seller ask me that before.
He grumbled for a minute, and I could swear I heard someone scream bloody murder from somewhere in the apparently large house. I wanted to pretend it was part of the song, but there had been no vocals up to that point. And the scream wasn't exactly melodic. The slapping stopped and I started to suspect that it had never been slapping to begin with, but maybe chopping. I shuddered and then he spoke.
"Well, alright. Send 'em over. We'll entertain some new guests.", He laughed heartily and I could hear the phlegm in his throat. He hung up before I had a chance to say anything else.
I felt slimy, somehow. But, he gave me approval, and I was glad to be done with the call. I approved the appointment and went to the next call. A few calls went by and I had completely forgotten about the whole thing. I just absorbed myself in my mind numbing work, powering through my day.
It wasn't until about 3 hours later that I got a call from a home owner. They had been called earlier for a showing and the agent never showed up. I pulled up their information, and as soon as I saw the agent's name, I got a chill up my spine. It was the same agent that had shown the house with the music and the screaming. I pulled his profile up on my screen. I wasn't even paying attention to the complaints of the home owner on the line. I saw that this appointment was the next on his schedule, and it had been past the showing time for an hour. He never showed after going to that house on the farm road.
I rushed the angry home owner off the phone with whatever bullshit customer service response my brain manufactured. I don't even remember what I said. I tried calling the agent, but he didn't answer. It went straight to voicemail. With real estate agents, that's pretty common, but this time it was unnerving. I called his office, under the guise of getting approval for an open house on one of his listings. Usually a sure fire way to skip through the lies of "he's not in the office right now" or "he's currently with a client". But his assistant seemed sincere when she told me he hadn't returned to the office today, and that he wasn't currently answering his cell phone. She even seemed a little worried, as though this wasn't normal for him.
I tried to reassure myself that it was fine. It's quite regular for agents to just not answer their phones for days at a time. I pushed the weird and dark thoughts from my mind and went about my day. But like a fly that won't stop buzzing around your face, the thought just wouldn't leave my mind. The sound of the screaming, the odd old music, and the heaving, grunting man who seemed all too happy for visitors. What the hell did I send those people into?

[6/29/2015 4:12:25 PM] zɔᴉʍolʎqʎzɹԀ uɐƃo˥: I'm from Texas but grew up in Georgia for a lot of years in a town that in the early 90s had the KKK march while Oprah was in town culture shaming the local residents. It was an almost all white town, different from the place we lived in Texas which was maybe 60% white and 40% hispanic. We had heard of the KKK, but it was surreal as a kid seeing them in person as a kid. My parents taught me to always judge people by their actions, but they were protective of me hanging out with others kids, except the hispanics. Even my own grandmother whooped me one time when she came out to find me at the mcdonalds playground talking to a black kid.
A lot of that I didn't understand so I guess in my rebelling teenage years I decided I was going to go against all of that, what I considered to be unjustified racism and bought into liberal brainwashing and white guilt.
In college, on a very liberal campus I even threatened my own life by OKing a nigger to sublet my roommate's room. He had the stereotypical fat ass dead eye coal burner girl friend.
Those 3 months were the most eye opening of my life!
Here's just a list of stuff I can recall off the top of my head and keep in mind, up until half way through this I was determined to be respecting to a fault to satisfy a fantasy of treating niggers like people.
-Ni(gger)Shawn used my razor and got his shitty ape hair all over it even after I asked him not too.
-Ni(gger)Shawn stealing (he called it "borrowing while I was asleep") my car which resulted in the windshield getting shot out when he was buying drugs and apparently tried to rip off the guy
-Ni(gger)Shawn turning up the AC all the way after I told him he hadn't paid any of the power bills and it was expensive to do so in the southern summer heat. (One time he was in the middle of cooking and must have heard me pull up and turned up the heater all the way up and ran out the door leaving his nigger food on the stove)
-Ni(gger)Shawn "borrowing" my playstation and n64 and games and movies saying he had taken them to a friends house and it was all cool. He had pawned them to pay for whiskey and drugs.
I was working at a gas station during college and one time he came in and tried to sell me coke. I told him to get the fuck out, no I didn't want any drugs.
Now, at this gas station it was equal distance between the projects and the dorms. I knew a lot of black lotto ladies, a lot of black thieving kids. They would steal bread, milk and cans of beans and waited until I had a long line or came in only when they saw a bunch of people in the store. I knew their mothers and I knew they were hungry, sometimes I'd ring it up and pay it myself when they left, because even if they are nigglets they don't deserve to be abused, the same as any other animal. I still don't feel bad about that. Maybe they didn't rob someone because they didn't feel hungry that night or something.
Anyway, the nigger older folks were probably the only ok folks in that bunch of niggerland. They had a sense of shame that was evident. When my nigger fuck head roommate tried to sell me coke, one of the older guys who was reading the paper waiting for his nephew to grab his beer, he put the paper down and starred out at Ni(gger)Shawn walking away and gave me the best piece of advice in my life:
(obviously paraphrasing it's been more than a decade):
"That mother fucker live with you? You know he thinks you're a bitch right? A pushover? You shouldn't make no mistake, he's a nigger. I'm a nigger, he's a nigger, my little nephew is a nigger, and that little nigger is pushing your buttons and was probably hoping your boss would be in when he pulled that shit. I'd kick that nigger out and wise up"
M, the older nigger that told me this, was completely right. I was being a little bitch, letting that nigger walk all over me out of some sense of guilt for shit I never fucking did. I mean, motherfucker, it took a nigger to give me back my self respect! That's how social justified I was, I didn't even want to share this story because it sounds pathetic, and that's because it fucking is. But I'm proud now and I think other people need to hear this for their own personal growth.
As the shift went on, I thought about what M said, looking at the security cameras and the niggers prowing the student's parked cars in the back, the niggers playing dice behind the store and the kids asking money from students acting like they were homeless.
I called my landlord that night and he said racism wasn't a reason to break a lease and Ni(gger)Shawn had been paying his rent so he'd take me to court if I broke lease. I broke lease. I had a new outlook on life, I learned the truth. I ended up paying $2500 for the remainder of my lease and I moved in with some friends of friends who had just moved to town.
Once that lightbulbs goes off and you understand, actually understand, that black people aren't owed shit by white people today and that their culture informs them to be little pieces of shit, then you start looking at everything in your day like it was the first time. The stinky smelly niggers on the bus never getting up for elderly white folk (even today I'll get up for an elderly nigger). The fucking thug downlow fags always trying to run an angle on someone. The fucking double standard sheboon nignug telling everyone their children were going to church and turning their families around.
Fuck all that.
And you know what? I wouldn't even refer to myself as a real racist. I have many hispanic, asian, white and puerto rican friends, no problems with any of them. But niggers will be niggers and because of my past experience with them, I can say for myself that I simply don't like black people.
Don't confuse my few anecdotal experiences as my only justification for my turning towards the light of reason and logic either. Once your eyes are clear, you'll see nigger stink in every facet of your life that will disgust you. And it seems like everyone but whites and other non-blacks in America has been trying to keep you from feeling this. They'll shame you into a label (racist). They'll tell you you're just agitated by a single event and you shouldn't judge a group of people by a few. And they're right, judge a group of people by most of them.

Thanks to their incredible influence over allies in Congress, three nasty provisions that would gut the Federal Communications Commission's ability to enforce new Net Neutrality rules have been buried deep inside a 158-page government funding bill.[1] And this must-pass package is moving fast through the House.

That means this bill could go to the House floor any day now for a full vote, and we need to make sure that every single member of Congress knows how dangerous these provisions are.

I wanted to draw your attention to this important petition that I recently signed:

"Add a firepole to the new LTT/LMG office!"

[7/7/2015 3:40:53 PM] A House DJ.: Seriously, this song had SO MUCH POTENTIAL. Literally ONE element, just ONE, brought it down SO PAINFULLY HARD! It makes me hurt inside! I feel so sorry for this song! It's like being on a long-ass level in a little platformer game and falling off short of making it to the finishing platform. Skrillex, Diplo & Justin Bieber nailed EVERY LAST BIT of this song from the production to the vocals - that said one element was unfortunately the most important part: the climax. IT HAD NO FREAKING CLIMAX. I was unsure if the "drop" part was actually a drop - it just blasted a chunk of problems all in one. No change in percussion or volume, no buildup, no change in melody really, no change in tone, NOTHING. MONOTONE. It means the song never got anywhere. Sure, it was designed to sound like a phone call and capture that "waiting" feeling of a lost relationship, perhaps, but waiting also means longing, and longing for something can come with its emphasis. This song had no emphasis. The melody was beautiful, the vibe was perfect, the vocals were FANTASTIC, and EVERYTHING worked except for that one crucial part. Sorry for being Karl Urban with the metaphors but it's like a structure with so many support beams, and the strongest one right in the center holding everything up the most just collapsing. In this case it wasn't there, so the song just fell. Like that. Thud. On the ground a lot harder than it should have. The little support beams indicating all the good parts of the song just shattered as the structure fell. It's quite sad. I HOPE TO ALL THE GODS, FORCES, POWERS, PENGUINS AND MAJESTIC BEARDS that a remix does this song justice. It NEEDS a redeeming factor. It deserves it completely.﻿

Stranger: Hello.
You: Hey
Stranger: I am literally about to die.
Stranger: Tonight.
You: Why
You: did you get shot
Stranger: Well, I served my mission on Earth.
Stranger: I was sent on earth to fulfill an objective.
You: and that was...?
Stranger: Find my soul mate.
You: So what, you're just gonna leave them then?
Stranger: no.
Stranger: She gave Me Her venomous kiss.
Stranger: It kills Her first.
Stranger: It takes a while to fully shut My body down.
You: I'm failing to understand.
Stranger: Okay.
You: are you being literal or...?
Stranger: Well, the story is long. Like, really, really, really long.
Stranger: Yes, literal.
Stranger: That was the way we were to kill ourselves.
You: so it was literally venom and you are literally going to die
Stranger: She is endowed with the ability to kiss Her soul mate.
Stranger: However, it is no ordinary kiss. It releases a hidden packet of venom in Her ody.
Stranger: body.
You: so
Stranger: It kills Her immediately.
Stranger: As soon as it reaches Me, My body takes it in.
You: rattlesnake venom lipstick
Stranger: Haha.
Stranger: You could say that.
Stranger: But, yes.
Stranger: Literally.
You: holes.
You: that was a good book.
Stranger: What would you advise someone who is about to leave Earth for eternity?
You: make the best of it
Stranger: of the last day here?
Stranger: or eternity out of here?

You: last day
You: do whatever
You: nobody cares.
You: last day
You: do what you've wanted too all your life
You: kill a man
You: steal a car
Stranger: eh.
You: go to russia
Stranger: there is a restriction.
Stranger: I live with my mother.
You: ah.
Stranger: And she is fucking strict.
Stranger: Like, fucking strict.
You: so just fucking sit there and wait for here to find you dead.
Stranger: No, no.
Stranger: My master is kind.
You: at least leave for a bit and don't stink up the house.
You: with your rotting corpse.
Stranger: I am dying in someone else's home.
Stranger: A family friend's.
You: why not someone you hate's home
You: because
You: dead people smell
You: bad
You: i've seen and smelled one once
You: it smelled like cat piss and rotten meat
You: Not pleasant
Stranger: well, oh well.
Stranger: Not my problem.
You: k.
Stranger: I find the human body to be disgusting.
Stranger: I always have.
Stranger: I am so glad to finally ditch mine.
You: we breathe one of the most corossive gasses, and drink one of the most potent solvents.
You: so
You: yeah
Stranger: Even the most beautiful humans are still disgusting.
You: because it's what's on the inside...
Stranger: Well, we're just talking on a physical level.
You: through the internet
You: you're probably some troll from 4chan, just like most people here.
You: or maybe you're the one serious person on here
You: fuck knows

[7/12/2015 7:21:33 PM] Logan.: Those god damn "I can't even"s.
You know, those typical reddit liberals that come in here and post generic comments like" this sub is disgusting"
Or when they call out a coontown resident outside this sub saying "this guy posts in coontown!" then more liberals follow with "Wow... Just wow. I can't even... Just wow."
The "I can't even"s are a threat to this country even more than niggers since they TOLERATE this behavior, they're also a threat to free speech.
If there is anything I hate in this world more than niggers, it's those fucking "I can't even"s.

[2:05:48 AM] Logan.: There he is. There he goes again

Look everyone he posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?? Oh my god.

I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room giggling like a little girl as you once again type your little 'HE' thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don’t even fill in the captcha, maybe you’re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass so you just choose the picture. Oh we all know the picture, the uh epic orange monkey isn’t it? I imagine you, little shit, laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos onto the floor. But its ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh that’s right, did I fail to mention? You live with your mother! You’re a fat fucking fuck up and she’s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all god damn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a dumb monkey rap meme. Just imagine this, she had you and then she thought you were going to be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand and then you became a NEET. A pathetic DK rap fag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even talk try to you because all you say is "WALNUTS, PEANUTS".

You became a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he’s done a million times now.

And that’s all you’ll ever be.

[7/14/2015 5:53:12 PM] Logan.: 9/11 Was In Fact An Inside Job!
Here are 20 ways that shows it is: 

1.) Steel Weakens 50% at 2000*F. 

2.) Steel melts at 2500*F 

3.) The 9/11 Commission Report states that fires hit 1800*F. 

4.) The hottest a fire can burn outside not contained is 1200*F. 

5.) The lease holder (Larry Silverstein) took out a 6 billion dollar policy for terror attacks 6 weeks before the attacks. 

6.) A missile hit the pentagon. 

7.) There was no evidence of anything left by even the smallest Boeing 757. 

8.) Why can't they release more angles of the "plane" footage? 

9.) The Pentagon has the most cameras than any other building in the world. 

10.) Why could Flight 93 never be found? 

11.) Flight 93 landed in 2 places, Ohio and supposedly Pennsylvania. 

12.) Why did Bush say he saw the first plane hit the first tower? 

13.) Why did the FBI take the gas station across the street's tape that recorded what hit the Pentagon. 

14.) Why did Bush tell the FBI to stop following Bin Laden? 

15.) Why were Bin Ladens' family members flown out of the country without question? (The document is now declassified). 

16.) Why were many political figures called and told not to fly on the morning of the attack? 

17.) There is a history of govt. sponsored terror. (Also declassified). 

18.) Governments use fear to control you. 

19.) Why did Silverstein (Leaseholder for all 7 buildings) say to "pull building 7? 

20.) The term "pull" is a common demolition term before they demolish a building.

[7/16/2015 7:31:11 PM] Logan.: strange comp maps today
[7/16/2015 8:16:08 PM] Logan.: I come here to be among the filth like me. The misogynists, the pedophiles, the transsexuals, the irreligious, the gays, the bi's, the racists, the otakus (and by that, I refer to the dakimakura-owning, waifu-loving dirt of society with posters of 2D anime girls all over the walls. The guy who spends all his money on a better computer and multiple anime figures to litter his walls and shelves).
I do not come here to listen to how and your girlfriend had a tiff and you want help getting back together.
I do not come here to listen to your preaching about how easy it is to lead a normal life.
I do not come here to AIM or MSN or otherwise 'chat' with you.
I do not come here to listen to your disgusting drivel about how you spend time everyday watching anime with your girlfriend and need a recommendation for another.
If I wanted any of that shit, I'd go to gaiaonline, or myspace, or facebook.
No, I come here to look at pathetic losers post their fantasies about dating their 2D lover.
I come here to see pedophiles exchange erotica involving underaged minors.
I come here to watch stormfront refugees fabricate various 'evidence' about how other races are inferior to whites.
I come here to view the tips and stories given by crackheads addicted to oxy.
I come here to revel in the dirt of humanity so that I can feel at home.
I've already done as best as I possibly can to filter shit out. I've got the 4chan filter, I can hide individual posts, I can hide threads, and various other annoyances taken care of, but it doesn't help nowadays.
If I wanted normal, I'd go somewhere else.
But you do not understand this desire, and so will respond with "LUL4CHANIZSECRETBASE" or some other nonsense rather than actually argue for your staying here.
Fucking normalfags.

mind fuckery
[10:32:13 AM] Mack: So a long time ago, about six months ago, my friend shared games with me on Origin. ( Like Steam but with other games from the company EA. ) And in this collection, he had Titanfall and The Sims 4. So I quickly downloaded the Sims 4 to play. When it was finished, I launched it and made my character. He was fat, had a pony tail, fedora, classes, overcoat, cargo shorts, really long socks and sandles. He was really good with computers, a slob, and gluttonous. He also lived with his mother, who loved him very much and cleaned up after him. She was saggy and old. So when I got into the house, I made a room for this guy, I named him Mootykins. His room had a bed, toilet, Snack machine, and the best computer I could get him. The rest of the house was in poor conditions. I think his mom was really depressed or something. Mootykins showered maybe 1 every week? Anyways, eventually he was so good with computers he got a job with an illegal hacking company. He started making lots of money. Keep in mind, this guy is like 24. He finds a REALLY old woman, and falls in love with her. They force an old couple out of the biggest house in Oasis springs, and that's where their life began. They had amazing gaming setups and had sex every day. My friend kept yealling " GRANNY PANTIES " in my ear. But it was clear my mom missed me.  Every single day she would come over. I just stopped answering the phone calls and the door. She would call and knock 3 times a day. She would peer through my bay window, my slider door, my front window. She was a down right stalking. When Mootykins and the old woman were woohooing, she would peer through the bedroom window. I went to the museum with my wife and had fun, but when we were leaving, I could see my mom following us. I went out to go mix drinks. By 11pm, I went next door to the club, but I could see my mom on the park bench. She was stalking me the entire time of 4 hours. Eventually my guy was so successful, but my mom was such a creep, I just got off. I haven't even played on that character since. So there is the story of Mootykins, how he became the lowest of the low, to the richest and most powerful

[4:48:09 AM] Logan.: Bethesda Plans To Revisit Skyrim Paid Mods After Fallout 4
[4:48:20 AM] Logan.: In an interview with GameSpot , Bethesda exec Pete Hines revisited the Skyrim paid mods controversy and shared some of his plans to give paid mods another shot. However, Hines confirmed that the Skyrim paid mods situation will definitely have to wait until Bethesda ships Fallout 4 , due this November 2015.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim paid mods system basically allowed modders to choose to put up their mods for cash rather than for free. The revenue stream was split up as follows: Bethesda took 45%, Valve took 30%, and modders took 25%. Many community members took issue with the monetization scheme, stating that modders as the creative party should be paid more for their efforts.

Back in April, Bethesda stated, "Is this the right split? There are valid arguments for it being more, less, or the same. It is the current industry standard, having been successful in both paid and free games. After much consultation and research with Valve, we decided it's the best place to start."

After all, as Bethesda noted when the controversy first went down, 25 percent is what modders have always received via the Steam Workshop. But ultimately, Valve pulled the paid mods down, stating , “We've done this because it's clear we didn't understand exactly what we were doing.”

If Skyrim paid mods come back, Hines confirmed that Bethesda still fully expects a cut of the profits -- and it’s fair to think that they’re aiming for a significant one.

"Our belief is, 'We made the game, we made the game you're making a thing for.' So just like anything else, there is some kind of involvement that we're going to have in that," he said.

In fact, Hines still appears still optimistic about the entire concept, regardless of its disastrous execution.  "I think our stance on it is we're going to re-evaluate it going forward," Hines said. "I think that we feel like there is a case to be made that people who spend a lot of time working on mods ought to be able to have a way of monetizing what they're doing.”

But fine-tuning the balance of moneys paid out will have to wait; Fallout 4 comes out on November 10, 2015 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.

[7/19/2015 11:35:52 PM] Logan.: In the past few months, I haven't been entirely myself. Not the Trollpasta admin Fatal, or the fourth bureaucrat on the Spinpasta wiki. I have not been the person that you have all known and cared for. From April, I have been constantly angry after a demotion, and took on my rage by isolating myself from my family and taking it out on everyone, possibly myself.
 
In May I had experienced a downfall. It was something that I had said to demote myself for, but couldn't do it because it was a stupid reason to do it. During and after that month, I had signed up for a site that I had abandoned back in 2012 because I was a desperate piece of shit. I had met someone on the site, and had went to the mall with this person. The mall meet was originally supposed to allow me to meet new people. Rather than hanging out for 10-20 minutes, we had hung out for the whole hour that we had spent. Then I had made an excuse that I had Social Anxiety Disorder. I even did show signs of it; I was unhappy, was in constant fear, and had panicked numerous of times. I only had asked my mom to get help for this once, but she had put it off on me getting a job. After some complaining, and trying to start numerous of conversations with the friend, the friend had blocked me on the social networking site. And that was when I realized that I had deep emotions for the person, but it was too late for me to say anything. I had asked my mother again, which resulted in a fight. She wouldn't want her boy to be in a "mental hospital" for SAD, said that the person who was helping me at the time was the cause for all of this issue, and after I yelled at her saying it was not she had threaten to break my neck. That was the cause of the first inactivity blog, because I was supposed to be limited on my computer time.
 
After that experience, I had dragged myself down to hate myself even farther. This time, finally taking it out on my family. I didn't show any signs of happiness when I went around with them, I had been lippy and mean towards my family because they wouldn't allow me to go anywhere or do anything that I wanted to do by myself. The first time I showed unhappiness and this meanness was when my mother tried to fix the blanket that I was wearing at a baseball game, and I had shown signs of restraint because I didn't want to be mothered. After I while, we had went to the Cheap Trick/Boston concert. She had said that I showed signs of this. After hearing her say that I began to have more panic attacks and I had died a little that day. Before the day of the Stars and Stripes Festival, I had eliminated all of my fears of being social and decided to eliminate the fear and strike a conversation with someone. Did that work out so well? No. Even if my parents weren't around, I wouldn't be able to strike up a conversation with someone even if I had wanted to.
 
After that festival, I had slowly became to the bitter person that I was back in late May - Early June, but worse than what I was. I had started I had banned a user, because I was just concerned about his behavior. After doing that, I had been harassed offsite and was a target for insults by the group chat. One message, which a user had said that everyone talked behind my back, and wished pain and death for me, made me cry. At that point, I wanted to give up on life. But I didn't. Then I had done something that was a miscommunication, and that was DA LIZT. It was a user blacklist; didn't allow certain users to come on to the SPWC, and was banned immediately after arrival. After that incident, I had began to be more assaulted off-site. I had been labeled as a mentally handicapped person over on the site. Although it didn't make me sad like the user's message, it had made me more mad.
 
Due to the past few days, I had started omitting myself from most of my family activity (other than concerts, and playing the game with my dad and uncle), had numerous of panic attacks, tried to slowly kill myself by binge eating and drinking, went to bed around the times that I would wake up to study for a test/go to school, and had attempted to make myself bleed twice by sink plug.
 
But what about the pain in my chest? All of the pain that I had experienced, other than the insults, were about the stuff that had happened in May. After I had tried to get rid of this feeling, I cannot get rid of this feeling towards one person. There were times that the pain wasn't there and I was happy on the outside, I was never really happy on the inside. I always feel like something was missing. And I can't go back and fix those mistakes that I had and be happy completely, but can't. I even had tried to, but can't. There were times that it stayed away, but the whole thing is like an STD to me. It goes away for a few days, but it stays for good.
 
As much as I do not want to leave for this temporal time, because I do not want to leave the job that I care so much deeply, the feeling of mistakes had eaten my soul. After numerous of complaints, I had given one user three options. And one of the options that the user had chose for the best of me was this option:
 
I revoke my rights, or have them be revoked by another active bureaucrat. I want to be insured that I will get my rights back after I come back. I don't want to be slapped on the ass and said "You requested it, start your shit fresh." I don't want to trace my steps back from rollback, and all the way up to bureaucrat/admin.
 
Will this cure my pain? I have high hopes, but I do know that it'll relieve all of the stress that I had suddenly got from this site.  See you all when I get unblocked!

[7/22/2015 6:34:37 PM] Logan.: So my job involves going around to pools in different apartment complexes and gyms and maintain the pool chemistry. Some days pools don't need fixing because they're properly taken care of by the housing association and respected by the tenants. Other pools need consistent attention.
Pool A:
Perfectly maintained chlorine/pH levels.
Lots of debris/leaves from surrounding trees/bushes
Consistently needs vacuuming. Possible leaking due to an old crack.
Pool B:
Mostly maintained chlorine/pH levels.
Hardly any debris/leaves from surrounding bushes
Lots of trash on a regular basis, but always in proper receptacles
Pool C:
Varying chlorine/pH levels. Consistently needs attention
Consistent yellow mustard algae. Requires large amounts of chemicals to kill
Chicken bones, sugary drink spillage, broken glass, beer cans pizza boxes in and around pool
Broken ladders/chairs/tables that need repairs on a weekly basis
Guess the nigger pool!
If you answered C, you are correct! Pool A, while in disrepair, is in a retirement village. It gets more attention but no one goes in and leaves it worse than when they found it. Pool B is in a college area where lots of parties happen, but always taken care of and cleaned up after. I have to take out trash more often, but at least it's in one spot. Pool C is in complete disrepair. The nigs in the housing association do not respect safety and health standards and then relentlessly call my boss at 7 in the morning telling him that the pool looks awful, after I was there at 8am the morning before cleaning the mess from the night before that. They come in, treat the place like a pig sty, and leave knowing full well that I'll come in and clean up after them. I fucking hate their entitled bullshit attitudes, and it's one of the many reasons I started coming to this place.
When that pool party incident happened I posted here knowing full well why these kids were being kicked out. TL;DR GROIDS AND POOLS DO NOT MIX.
[7/22/2015 6:38:44 PM] Logan.: one question to shut up an sjw for good
[7/22/2015 6:38:44 PM] Logan.: Percentage wise, what are the ethnic demographics of your neighborhood?
According to a reputable source, mine is 82% black, 12% hispanic, and 6% other.
I have asked this about 20 times and only once have I received an answer. The answer recieved was about 90% white btw.
They refuse to answer this question. They seize up. They know once they say 98% white they have lost all credibility.
Just look at the last troll posts. No response. Even If they do respond they will side step the question and say "Why does it even matter?"
The reason why I and many others hate black people is because we have lived amongst them. We didn't wake up one morning and just decided to hate them.
I cannot be on every troll post, so ask the question when a sjw posts here. Make it one simple line, dont add any additional details.

[7/22/2015 6:40:47 PM] Logan.: Did you ever try to put a broken piece of glass or porcelain back together?  Even if the pieces fit, you can't make it whole again the way it was.
[7/22/2015 6:41:14 PM] Logan.: But if you're clever, you can still use the pieces to make other useful things.  Maybe something wonderful, like a mosiac.
[7/22/2015 6:41:56 PM] Logan.: Well, the world just broke like glass, and everyone is trying to put it back together like it was, but it'll never come together the same way.

[7/29/2015 3:35:41 PM] Logan.: I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.
Under active development:
Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
AlienBlue bug fixes
AlienBlue improvements
Android app
Next up:
Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
Anti-brigading
Modmail improvements
As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!
I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.
update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting!

[7/31/2015 2:19:55 AM] Logan.: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM) that control access to copyrighted works. It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.[1][2] Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users.

The DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and indirect liability of Internet service providers and other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the European Union in the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000. The Copyright Directive 2001 implemented the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty in the EU.

[7/31/2015 6:24:53 AM] Logan.: "You must be young not to know that even the best friends may fail. It happens to everyone, sooner or later. Trust is good, control is better.

Just imagine you fuck the wrong person and have phoned to them. Then they decide to destroy your life. Do you really want to have an open WLAN?

Just imagine, someone you know has a psychological episode and decide you are the devil, because they suddenly became clinically paranoid.

There is plentry of reason to be cautious.

People who think like you are allowing the establishment to take away the little freedom we still have left. Our ancestors died for those freedoms, you anti-hero. Become an hero, please."

You: bleh
Stranger: God, nigga
Stranger: I hate speaking with mobile users
You: ^
Stranger: Those pauses.
Stranger: Those awful pregnant pauses
Stranger: The question is this:
Stranger: how likely do you think a half-cooked eggshell shard is to cut through some part of a person's digestive system?
Stranger: probably not that likely...
Stranger: right
You: not very likely
You: considering how thick your stomach lining is
You: and how easily they're digestid
You: digested
You: i'm tired.
Stranger: yeah but at the same time an eggshell has given me a papercut before
Stranger: are papercuts exclusive to paper
You: have you ever put an egg into coke?
You: the shell disolves
Stranger: yes
You: just like in your stomach
Stranger: I think that has more to do with..
Stranger: hey
Stranger: you're right
Stranger: thanks
You: it won't hurt you.
You: mm
You: mhm
You: is that all?
Stranger: well I was hoping we could have some worthwhile conversation
Stranger: and then I could go to bed and smoke some more and drift off happily
You: we can, but i'll make a lot of typing errors
Stranger: that's okay
You: because it's 7 am and i haven't slept
You: since 2 pm yesterday
Stranger: that sounds awful
You: it is
Stranger: you should probably just go to bed

You: I'll be over here
You: eating cheese

Stranger: or shouldnt be
You: those round buttery things
You: shits
Stranger: the greasy ones
You: yeah
Stranger: yeah.
Stranger: disgusting little shits
Stranger: a cracker shouldnt be able to be eaten on its own like those can
Stranger: I can eat an entire packet of those shits in one sitting
Stranger: that's not right at all
You: those probably gave me diabetes.
You: I ate 2 packs of the things
Stranger: and you caught the beetus just like that
Stranger: thats unlucky
You: darn
You: okay
You: have fun with your eggs

[8/3/2015 5:24:21 AM] Logan.: An Internet meme (/ˈmi:m/ MEEM) is an activity, concept, catchphrase or piece of media which spreads, often as mimicry, from person to person via the Internet.[1] Some notable examples include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called "planking") and uploading a short video of people dancing to the Harlem Shake. 

A meme is "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture".[2] An Internet meme may take the form of an image, hyperlink, video, picture, website, or hashtag. It may be just a word or phrase, including an intentional misspelling. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources. They may relate to various existing Internet cultures or subcultures, often created or spread on various websites, or by Usenet boards and other such early-internet communications facilities. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet, because the instant communication facilitates word-of-mouth transmission. 

The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, as an attempt to explain the way cultural information spreads;[3] Internet memes are a subset of this general meme concept specific to the culture and environment of the Internet. In 2013 Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity—distinguished from biological genes and Dawkins' pre-Internet concept of a meme which involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate replication as in Darwinian selection.[4] Dawkins explained that Internet memes are thus a "hijacking of the original idea," the very idea of a meme having mutated and evolved in this new direction.[5] Further, Internet memes carry an additional property that ordinary memes do not—Internet memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for example, social networks) that renders them traceable and analyzable.[6] 

Internet memes are a subset that Susan Blackmore called temes—memes which live in technological artifacts instead of the human mind.[7] 

Image macros are often confused with internet memes and are often miscited as such, usually by their creators. However there is a key distinction between the two. Primarily this distinction lies within the subjects's recognizability in internet pop-culture. While such an image may display an existing meme, or in fact a macro itself may even eventually become a meme, it does not qualify as one until it reaches approximately the same level of mass recognition as required for a person to be considered a celebrity.

[8/3/2015 10:14:11 PM] Mack: I know, I know I've let you down
I've been a fool to myself
I thought that I could
live for no one else
[8/3/2015 10:14:16 PM] Mack: But now through all the hurt and pain
Its time for me to respect
the ones you love
mean more than anything.
[8/3/2015 10:14:22 PM] Mack: So with sadness in my heart
I feel the best thing I could do
is end it all
and leave forever
whats done is done, it feels so bad
what once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again
my world is ending
[8/3/2015 10:14:27 PM] Mack: I wish that I could turn back time
'cause now the guilt is all mine
can't live without the trust from those you love.
I know we can't forget the past
you can't forget love and pride
because of that it's killing me inside
[8/3/2015 10:14:35 PM] Mack: It all returns to nothing, it all comes
tumbling down, tumbling down,
tumbling down,
it all returns to nothing, I just keep
letting me down, letting me down,
letting me down,
in my heart of hearts, 
I know that I could never love again
I've lost everything
everything, everything
that matters to me,
matters in this world

I wish that I could turn back time
'cause now all the guilt is mine
can't live without
the trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
we can't forget love and pride
because of that, its killing me inside 

It all returns to nothing, it all comes
tumbling down, tumbling down,
tumbling down
it all returns to nothing, I just keep
letting me down, letting me down,
letting me down
It all returns to nothing, it all comes
tumbling down, tumbling down,
tumbling down
it all returns to nothing, I just keep
letting me down, letting me down,
letting me down

[4:44:40 AM] Logan.: I cried.
[4:44:42 AM] Logan.: every time
[4:53:46 AM] Logan.: You sit on your front porch. watching the light across the street.  It flickers once.  It's 3:42 and you just realized that even though your family loves you, the only thing you need is someone to care for, someone to love.
[4:54:39 AM] Logan.: So you sit on your front porch, watching the light.  You might smoke a cigarette or two, but you don't really need them.  You watch the tree near the street light sway in the wind, scared of life.
[4:55:41 AM] Logan.: You might have had a girl in your life once, but it soured and went wrong.  It might have been your fault, but odds are that it wasn't.  Odds are is that she dumped you, because being with you made her depressed.  Then you realized that you just lost a great chance to turn your life around.
[4:55:52 AM] Logan.: So you sit outside on your front porch
[4:56:05 AM] Logan.: You watch the street light across the street.
[4:56:23 AM] Logan.: You might shed a tear or two, but this isn't a physical sadness that can be purged.
[4:56:52 AM] Logan.: This is a soul-crushing, black abyss kind of sadness.  And you are scared and alone, and all you want is someone to look at you and say:
[4:57:03 AM] Logan.: 'Everything will be okay, come with me.'
[4:57:16 AM | Edited 4:57:36 AM] Logan.: Instead, you sit on your front porch.
[4:57:24 AM] Logan.: You watch the street light.
[4:57:27 AM] Logan.: And you die inside.

[8/5/2015 10:32:38 PM] Logan.: gnight
[3:15:43 AM] Logan.: Today we are releasing an update to our Content Policy. Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.
Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.
Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.
Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.
I believe these policies strike the right balance.
update: I know some of you are upset because we banned anything today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.
[3:16:02 AM] Logan.: COONTOWN IS FUCKING BANNED
[3:21:19 AM] Logan.: Today we removed communities dedicated to animated CP and a handful of other communities that violate the spirit of the policy by making Reddit worse for everyone else: /r/CoonTown[1] , /r/WatchNiggersDie[2] , /r/bestofcoontown[3] , /r/koontown[4] , /r/CoonTownMods[5] , /r/CoonTownMeta[6] .
[3:23:09 AM] Logan.: the reason they were banned was because SJWs spammed emails directed at the reddit admins
[3:23:39 AM] Logan.: and yet
[3:23:47 AM] Logan.: /r/agsinstmensrights still fucking exists
[3:28:29 AM] Logan.: along with /r/feminism
[3:28:41 AM | Edited 3:28:49 AM] Logan.: Why haven't you banned SRS yet? They are the WORST offenders of breaking the rules you have set up, but you refuse to ban that subreddit.
Because the admins are SJW's who support racism against whites.
Why? Why do you continue to let SRS harrass people? Why do you continue to let SRS doxx people? Why do you continue to let SRS vote brigade? What makes SRS any different from Coontown? Or fatpeoplehate? Or Watchniggersdie?
Like I said, they belong to that group of bigots. That is the difference.
Is it a racial thing? Are you only banning racists? Do you not give a shit about anything else? What is going on?
Nope, they love racists! as long as you are racist against whites, Jews, or any other group they hate. You will notice /r/kiketown isn't even quarantined by these fucking neo nazis.
You keep on talking about being open with what you're doing, but you don't tell us anything about what we want to know.
Because you don't pay them. That is the only people they answer to now.
[3:29:02 AM] Logan.: Ban SRS already.
Why haven't you banned SRS yet? They are the WORST offenders of breaking the rules you have set up, but you refuse to ban that subreddit.
Why? Why do you continue to let SRS harrass people? Why do you continue to let SRS doxx people? Why do you continue to let SRS vote brigade? What makes SRS any different from Coontown? Or fatpeoplehate? Or Watchniggersdie?
Is it a racial thing? Are you only banning racists? Do you not give a shit about anything else? What is going on?
You keep on talking about being open with what you're doing, but you don't tell us anything about what we want to know.
What is even the point? Why are you even talking right now? Just letting us simmer in the absent silence is basically the same as what you're having us do right now.
"I believe this policies strike the right balance." Also, some people are exempt from them. Apparently.
[3:30:18 AM] Logan.: Fuck you Steve. I 100% GUARANTEE I will leave reddit PERMANENTLY if you decide to stifle free speech and appease the Jews. You cuck faggot, you make Ellen Pao look like Mother Theresa.

[3:35:33 AM] Logan.: AKA you can still do everything as normal, but there's some shitty 'warning' the first time you visit.
[3:35:45 AM] Logan.: those include but are not limited to:

[3:36:10 AM] Logan.: and many more

[3:54:56 AM] Logan.: A misogynist is a person who hates women. A person who hates men can be described as a misandrist, and the corresponding noun is misandry. But however prevalent the attitudes described by these words may be, the words themselves aren't common. There are currently only 29 examples of misandrist in the Oxford English Corpus, while misogynist appears more than 1,500 times; 68 uses of  misandry are overshadowed by over 2,000 examples of misogyny.

[8/12/2015 7:00:52 AM | Edited 7:00:59 AM] Logan.: Last Saturday there was a hit and run on a toddler in front of my apartment. My roommate and I were first responders, as everyone else was just staring dumbfounded or on the phone. I'm not sure how much detail I can share due to the fact it is still an active investigation but I believe i can say that her wounds were horrible to say the least.

I keep seeing her bleeding face as I close my eyes and I'm cursing myself for not having enough in my pathetic first aid kit I had in my car. The most I could do was keep her dad from moving her and even that memory hurts.

I have helped at a car crash before, and even felt with death before. But this little girl is really fucking with my mind. I didn't have enough to help her just a bit od gauze which I couldn't use (head injury) and a pathetic little road triangle so no one would whip down the road and hit anyone.

I am not ok right now. I mean I can get by with day to day stuff but God Damn that smashed face is going to haunt me. Please help.

Thankfully she is only in critical condition. She is Stable.

[8/12/2015 7:29:04 PM] Logan.: Whiny is an adjective meaning habitually complaining or of or like a whine. Whiney is the same as whiny, but it appears about a fourth as often (whiny is preferred in all main varieties of English). Whinny is the sound horses make.

[8/13/2015 8:28:12 AM] Logan.: I make them morbidly obese with green skin.  I make sure to give them the following traits:
>likes to be alone
>likes art
>hates the outdoors

The first thing I do once I have enough money, is build a small room in the basement, send him down there, and then remove the stairs.  I set him up a tiny little area with only an easel, a toilet, a fridge, a bed, a shower, and a trash bin.  All he does all day it paint.  That's it.  He paints and paints and paints and paints.  Eventually his paintings become very good and worth a lot of money.  Every few minutes I go downstairs and sell whatever painting he has finished, and return to my game.  

My family always ends up feeling blessed because of their fortune, but never find out about the horrible secret living beneath their home.

[8/13/2015 8:25:32 PM] Logan.: Have you set the Anonymous logo as your desktop background?
Do you still marathon all the episodes of Reboot on occasion?
Do you turn off all the lights and wear a Guy Fawkes mask when you browse Reddit?
Have you ever wanted to be the hacker 4 c h a n ?

THEN GET THIS GAME!!!

This is be best 1337 H4X0R simulator you will ever find. It's realistic enough and uses enough real-life terms to make you feel as if you could totally hack someone's computer if you went out and bought the right software, totally bro, I mean you already did it in Uplink.

Bad side is that it's one of those games where it's possible to miss the trigger for the storyline, and if that happens, the story just kinda goes on without you....

Also, sometimes the game kind of just expects you to know stuff - like where and which logs to delete so you don't get caught by the feds for a job you completed 3 days ago......

Also the game can get really repetative really quickly.....

But then you hack into a LAN system and you have to bypass the Proxy and brute-force crack the password so you can trace throught the system to unlock the file server locks and hack into the mainframe database! <- I didn't even make any of that up, you actually do that in this game.

Get dis.

[2:08:39 AM] Logan.: Step 1: Find Normie 11 yo on Twitch
Step 2: Everybody posts <Message Deleted by System 32>
Step 3: One or two people claim that they are twitch support and that we can
help wíth the system 32 Virus
Step 4: we obtain their stream key and put porn/gore on stream then get it
banned.

Step 4 Alternate: we obtain his skype and trick him into ruining his computer
with water and other liquids

[2:29:25 AM] Logan.: Fuck you. All of you. You shit on animators for being too violent and edgy acting like your these great judges of comedy, but then you turn around and you have your minutely 9/11 threads snickering about how jet fuel can't melt steel beams or that EPIC pic you found of a fucking plane falling into pair of buildings. And if anyone dares to respond with anything other than how these stupid "jokes" launched their sides to the toppest of lels like a GOOD legion hiveminder, you bombard him with EPIC replies about how much of a butthurt triggered retarded autistic amerifat nigger sperg Reddit jew goy neckbeard weeb fedora SJW spic Tumblrite he is. You completely lack the slightest amount of self-awareness, otherwise you would see how hypocritical you are, to say nothing about how pathetic you look repeating the same stupid "joke" about an event with such grave implications for over a decade. Hell, it wouldn't surprise me if you gaylords are jealous of people that are enjoying wealth and wealth and fame, while your flatulent neckbeard ass gets winded from doing anything but shitpost on mommy's computer. It's very clear why this place is considered the asshole of the Internet: because it's filled with human feces like YOU PEOPLE.

Fuck you. Fuck your mothers for birthing you. Fuck your dads for dicking your mothers.

[8/16/2015 6:45:40 PM | Edited 6:45:52 PM] Logan.: Rule 1. Don't bring religion into the internet 
Rule 2. Don't bring the INTERNET into REAL LIFE 
Rule 3. Trolololol 
Rule 4. CAPS IS LIKE CRUISE CONTROL, ALTHOUGH IT HELPS CONTROL IS STILL NEEDED. 
Rule 5. People don't care! Deal with it! 
Rule 6. If your a self-right down selfish bastard, the internet if for you! Just don't go around begging to people! 
Rule 7. There ARE girls on the internet, just sexy ones are hard to find. 
Rule 8. Community and dedication is one thing, but taking something to far is just wrong. There are things called limits. use them. They are nice. 
Rule 9. If you can't handle the troll, trollin' you. Don't be trollin' back. Or else your gonna start a troll war, and a portal paradox will start. 
Rule 10. SUCK MY CAAACK. 
Rule 11. Any douche-fag with the name "box" or "unknown" within their steam nickname. Are real self-rightous biggots. All they care about is their views, and that they are ALWAYS correct. Thats how they see themselves. 
Rule 12. 3 
Rule 13. If it exists. There is porn of it. If there isn't porn of it, it just hasn't been made yet. 
Rule 14. Raptor jesus IS real. He just doesn't like douche bags.

[8/18/2015 3:49:01 PM] Logan.: Now that you've assumed optimal reading position, slowly move your eyes from left to right, you know how to do that, right? Right! Try not to drool in the process, as clean up can be quite difficult as well as damaging to your sorroundings.

If you're unsure how to move your eyes from left to right, simply follow these instructions :
1.) Find a friend, enemy, family member, anyone.
2.) Escort your friend/enemy/family member to the nearest kitchen.
3.) Have the family member hit you over the head with a mallet for being a mistake.
4.) Lay down on the floor and attempt to swallow your own tongue as your companion continues to mericlessly bash you over the head with the mallet that you kindly provided them with.

An alternative method, if you have no friends you pathetic failure, is to simply lay on the ground and attempt to swallow your own tongue. This works very well, if done properly.

[8/18/2015 8:42:25 PM | Edited 8:42:40 PM] Logan.: "HACKER CENTRAL

Finally got to rank 5 and played my first competitive game....

Within the first minute of the round start, my whole team was headshot killed, by a single player. A few seconds later, more of the same, instant headshot deaths....same player. I checked his profile, found that he had 4 VAC bans on file, a private profile, mutliple aliases and to top it off, he then begins bragging in chat about how VAC bans are easy to bypass and the anti cheat system in Dirty Bomb is a joke and he is essentially protest hacking....

A few short minutes later I get kicked from game for "suspicious activity" and the hacker continues on...finished the match 112-5. My team was never able to get out of spawn....

I wont deny that this game at its core is and can be really fun, but at the moment it is plagued with blatant and obvious hackers. VAC bans and VAC reporting currently does nothing, and there is currently no in game reporting system. 

I would strongly suggest staying away (or at least stay away from competetive) until its cleaned up..."
[8/18/2015 8:42:47 PM] Logan.: i know the guy who does this
[8/18/2015 8:43:05 PM] Logan.: he tries and succeeds to ruin every game made by these korean fucks

The anti-cheat system is a joke.
[8/18/2015 8:44:29 PM] Logan.: "Got perma-banned (for "third-party software") after having played a bunch without a hitch. I'm assuming it was because I forgot to delete my desktop shortcut to Process Hacker (the anti-cheat doesn't like it because it has "hack" in its name and XIGNCODE is just about the worst anti-cheat ever) and the damn anti-cheat scanned my system. When I contacted support about it, their reply was this:


"Due to the nature of this situation, I am sorry to inform you that I will not be able to release your account.

I know that you would like to see evidence or be provided a detailed explanation as to why your account has been banned. However, the evidence that we have gathered is proprietary information and cannot be disclosed. Therefore, we will not discuss the exact nature of your specific incident."


What a great company."

[8/22/2015 5:40:32 AM] Logan.: A lily pad grows so that each day it doubles its size (area). On the 20th day of its life, it completely covers the pond. On what day of its life was the pond half covered? 

The answer is the 19th day.

(you can make it multiple choice)
example: A. 5th B. 10th C. 15th D. 19th E. None of these.
[8/22/2015 5:40:57 AM] Logan.: 3+5+6=151872

5+5+6=253094

5+6+7=303585

5+5+3=251573

then 9+4+7=_______?

The solution to the first 4 digits is pretty straight forward, and I am sure most of you must have easily got it.

It works out to be a+b+c = (a*b)(a*c)??

The last 2 digits are really tough to crack…

Here’s how you do it. Reverse of {(a×b)+(a×c)-c}

So the number would (a×b),(a×c),{(a×b)+(a×c)-c}reverse.

So for 1st one: 3+5+6=151872;
axb = 3×5 = 15; axc = 3×6 = 18;
{(a×b)+(a×c)-c} = ((3×5)+(3×6)-6} = 27
— Reverse of 27 is 72

So 9+4+7=_______?

axb = 9×4 = 36;
axc = 9×7 = 63;
{(a×b)+(a×c)-c} = ((9×4)+(9×7)-7} = (36+63-7)=92
— Reverse of 92 is 29.
Hence 9+4+7 = 366329

[8/22/2015 10:48:50 PM] Logan.: "Have you ever been banned on a server?"
[8/22/2015 10:48:51 PM] Logan.: yes
[8/22/2015 10:48:57 PM] Logan.: "Why?"
[8/22/2015 10:48:58 PM] Logan.: The few servers I've been banned on were usually for pissing off the admin.  the last ban was on an ftb infinity server (ayy lmao) for 'griefing'.

Sauce?  Sauce.

So the admins had a rules board at spawn, and they had towny.  you could set up a town, but you can still get your stuff stolen to 'liven up the server' (I'm pretty sure it's because they can't set up towny correctly).  so me and a few friends went on the server, and there was this guy with a helper tag in his name.  This kid thought he was fucking god.  He could ban, kick, spawn in items, etc.  he was friends with the owner.  This kid (probably 9 from his grammar) decides it would be funny to start a war with me.  Boy was he wrong.  he started saying stupid shit, mocking me, teleporting to me, punching me, teleporting away, and stuff like that.  eventually I got fed up with it and called my friend who had been on the server before me, and was a mod. (emphasis on WAS.  they demoted him to a normal player for changing the time of day when this little shit is teleporting to people and nearly killing them.)  He knew where everyone's base was, because he had to keep tabs on people.  He told me where the 'helper''s base was.  I went there with 4 friends when everyone in his base was offline (besides him) and steal his ME drives.  he then proceeds to tell me to enjoy the ban.  I told him that the rules didn't say 'no stealing' explicitly, nor was it implied.  He then WENT TO SPAWN, BROKE A HOLE IN THE WALL, AND CHANGED WHAT THE RULES SAID RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  the owner gave zero fucks, and banned me about 10 minutes after we stole his shit.  of course, it was all stored in my hidden me system that isn't accessible without being in my town. (this bit was told to me by my friend that watched him do it) After I get banned,  he goes in to my town, fucking breaks through the wall using admin powers (and probably xray, that shit was hidden)  and steals all of my me drives.  all of MY me drives.  he doesn't just take his back, he FUCKING STEALS MINE.  So I log on with an alt, see my friend wasn't lying, and try to defend myself as if I'm just my friend.  he eventually tells me that he threw all of them into lava.  I went berzerk.  I had a stash of armour, explosives, weapons, etc. in a dirt shack.  he didn't bother to check that, apparently, because it was an 8x8x4 dirt cube.  I broke into it, took the armour, put it on, took the nukes, and proceeded to blow his base to smithereens.  He then went apeshit, banned everyone on the server at that time, and called the owner a, and I quote, "stupid cunt 4 not seting up bigbroter 2 stop fags like u frum destrying my base."  I shit you not, that's what he said.  I wish I had screenshots, the shit was hilarious.  Also, there were about 5 people on the server, 2 of them were founding players that were here from the beginning.  I log on with a 3rd alt the next day (fuck you, I got it for xmas).  the server had a map wipe.  the 'helper' quit, the banlist was wiped (because apparently they needed a new server and not just a new world), and the 'helper' was banned.  all that remains today is a dead, whitelisted server with 16 slots always open.  God knows what goes on there.

[8/26/2015 6:19:53 AM] Logan.: Most of the time when someone rants about how /b/ used to be good I never understand why. /b/ was never good, but I'm not talking about the quality of the place. 

/b/ was, is, and always will be a den for hardcore nerds, lonely sociopaths, and degenerate losers. While it is fun to come here once in a while, maybe frequently, that novelty really does fade fast. You visit to see something that will shock, offend, or humor you. You stay because you don't have any better reasons to get out of bed in the morning. That's how people end up spending hour after hour here, trying to see something, anything, that will make them laugh or rage or feel something.

And I have to wonder, how many users have died in these last years? How many of them spent their last few days on here while their life just kept rolling away from them? How many passed on, and all that was left of them were a bunch of images and songs from the net? And how many more will run right back to rotting away inside while time flashes by. 

Bare with my contemplation. I've just been thinking lately, and it just sounds like a hell I couldn't wish on anyone.
[8/26/2015 6:27:19 AM] Logan.: I used to do this in highschool and it worked everytime. Get something to use as a funnel, I used a paper plate, and get a container of salt and a gallon of room temp water. Mix the entire container of salt into the gallon of water and let it dissolve. Funnel the gallon of salt water into the bill slot. I'm not sure exactly whats happening but it shoots out quarters from the change return and cans just come pouring out. I would usually get about $5-$10 in quarters and about 7 or 8 cans of drink before it stopped working, but it worked everytime.
[8/26/2015 6:27:26 AM] Logan.: >actually fucking kills you
[8/26/2015 6:34:58 AM] Logan.: "why is the site shit now /b/?"
[8/26/2015 6:34:59 AM] Logan.: This site is getting too old.
>2mainstreem
I fucking hate how almost all of the content on /b/ is dicks and shit.
[8/26/2015 6:35:09 AM] Logan.: Because Snacks is gone, and our cucklord abandoned us.
[8/26/2015 6:37:31 AM] Logan.: How about this for a tip?

Most theaters will throw out their garbage by roughly twenty minutes after the initial showing of the last movie for the day. During the weekend, there will be perhaps one usher who will be responsible for throwing out this trash, and more often than not, they will exit a back-door that has to be propped open shut as not to lock themselves out. 

>Look up showtime of last movie in theater
>Wait nearby close to back door closest to dumpster
>Sneak into theater while employee is throwing out trash
>Float in to watch any movie in the theater
>Exit theater from back exit, no one the wiser

Best part is the theater technically isn't losing money if you had no intention on buying a ticket in the first place. 

Another tip: Visit a theater during a heavy storm that may have potential to knock power out. More often than not, they're handing out tickets to customers to make up for a power-outage, and that is the best time to swipe up a free ticket.

Also ask for military discounts - half of the time they never check for an ID.
[8/26/2015 6:39:04 AM] Logan.: Did you know, playing games is my favorite thing?
[8/26/2015 6:39:14 AM] Logan.: Not for fun, but just because I can be somebody else.
[8/26/2015 6:39:31 AM] Logan.: I don't really care if I'm a plumber saving a princess, or a trained marine.
[8/26/2015 6:39:41 AM] Logan.: As long as I'm not me.
[8/26/2015 6:40:00 AM] Logan.: I like playing games to pretend I matter to people, that people are counting on me
[8/26/2015 6:40:11 AM] Logan.: And if I ever mess up, I can just try again.
[8/26/2015 6:40:25 AM] Logan.: And someone always wants to see me, to talk to me.
[8/26/2015 6:40:29 AM] Logan.: And sometimes,
[8/26/2015 6:40:36 AM] Logan.: If I focus hard enough
[8/26/2015 6:40:39 AM] Logan.: I can pretend
[8/26/2015 6:40:45 AM] Logan.: That I'm not pretending
[8/26/2015 6:42:14 AM] Logan.: You're born alone, you know.
[8/26/2015 6:42:17 AM] Logan.: No friends.
[8/26/2015 6:42:20 AM] Logan.: No family.
[8/26/2015 6:42:23 AM] Logan.: Just you.
[8/26/2015 6:42:26 AM] Logan.: And you die alone
[8/26/2015 6:42:31 AM] Logan.: Nobody else dies with you
[8/26/2015 6:42:35 AM] Logan.: you fall over
[8/26/2015 6:42:39 AM] Logan.: and cease to exist
[8/26/2015 6:42:44 AM] Logan.: And this world
[8/26/2015 6:43:04 AM] Logan.: just drops a bunch of rues on top of you to make you forget those facts
[8/26/2015 6:43:11 AM] Logan.: But I never forget.
[8/26/2015 6:43:18 AM] Logan.: I'm living like there's no tomorrow,
[8/26/2015 6:43:24 AM] Logan.: Because there isn't one.
[8/26/2015 6:44:07 AM] Logan.: People say, that when you reach the bottom, you can only go up
[8/26/2015 6:44:24 AM] Logan.: But they forget that if you fell one time, you can fall a second, and a third.
[8/26/2015 6:44:30 AM] Logan.: There is no end to this torture.
[8/26/2015 6:48:06 AM] Logan.: Get in between 2am to 6am est. Always a weirdo on and the threads can last for more than 2 seconds. 

Issue for me is when USA and some of Yurop is on and most threads are porn based, and the rest are some rehashed bullshit. 

The cool shit happens when someone weird is on and is showing or doing something. The freak show is missing most dats. That's what's wrong. 

Also stop bitching and create new topics.

[8/27/2015 5:55:17 AM] Logan.: There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.

I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" Banana guy, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE." You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.

[8/29/2015 5:19:00 PM] Logan.: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) was a young boy, about 5 or so, who lived in a village. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) was not an ordinary boy, however. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) loved adventures. When ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ran away from home for the very first time, he was very scared. But then, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) got used to it. When ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ran away the second time, he became a very brave man, and instantly aged 27 years! When he was 32 years old, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) killed his entire village and his own family. He then went to another village and killed them too. When he went to the queens castle, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) blew it up and killed everyone there too! In the end, he went back to his original village and married his dead son. Thank you, and goodnight.

[8/30/2015 6:48:12 AM] Logan.: black
[8/30/2015 7:12:25 AM] Logan.: I went to Subway yesterday and got a 12" Italian B.M.T. on Italian bread, with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, green pepper, onion, black olive, banana pepper, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper, a small bag of Doritos, three cookies, and a large Diet Dr. Pepper. I was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audio book when I glanced up and saw the Subway worker I ordered from was outside puffing on an e-cig.

She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don't think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the Subway restaurant, but that is another story.

I went to Subway for dinner last night and got two 12" Meatball Marinaras on Italian Herbs & Cheese bread, each with provolone cheese, parmesan cheese, a cup of the soup of the day, three cookies, and a large Diet Dr. Pepper. As I was paying the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, 'why don't you eat inside instead of in the parking lot'.

That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don't want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy.

Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don't think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

How do you feel about eating in your vehicle in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant versus eating inside the restaurant?
[8/30/2015 7:49:17 AM] Logan.: sing 'NIGGERFAGGOT NIGGERFAGGOT NIGGERFAGGOTNIGGERFAGGOT" repeatedly through your amp as loud as it will go.
[8/30/2015 7:50:28 AM] Logan.: >free slaps for white men
[8/30/2015 7:50:29 AM] Logan.: >Go to booth
>Examine them each for a bit
>Pick the prettier one and say "you. I want to be slapped by you"
>Moan very sexually after getting slapped and massage my cock through my pants a little
>ask for another
>When they refuse, coyly ask "are you sure? I've been a VEEEERY white boy"

That would be the end of that stand
[8/30/2015 7:50:59 AM] Logan.: I'd slap them as I identify them as cisgendered straight identifying white men and I won't be oppressed by their definitions.

[4:12:45 PM] Mack: And everyone stays so...clean. That's the most unrealistic part for me. Like, what the heck are these actors eating that allows them to keep their buttholes so pristine? Ice chips? I mean, have you seen those dudes' dicks when they finish plugging ass? You could serve sushi off of them. A lot of sushi. For real, a lot of those gentlemen seem to suffer from elephantitis of the donger or something. Which makes their clean appearance even less believable seeing as how they are really plumbing the depths of their costar's asshole.
Now contrast this with the last time I had buttsex; there was a ruined comforter, a shattered skylight, and a dog so traumatized that he ended up needing psychiatric treatment for six months. The comforter and skylight in question were damaged from the shit that got tossed around during the act. I'm not sure where the dog came from. He just kind of showed up. If I had to guess, he was mostly likely drawn by my yelps of pleasure or possibly by the flatulence caused by my overindulgence of Chipotle burritos and autisanal cheeses, of which I confess a weakness for.
Anyway, the oral of the story is this: you can't just have anal sex without everything within twenty paces - especially yourself - getting soiled both mentally and physically. It's like going to the beach and not getting sand in your vagina. It's like eating ribs without getting sauce on your taint.
It just ain't possible.

[9/2/2015 4:33:42 AM] Logan.: Recently, it was brought to light that Hideo Kojima is parting ways with Konami after the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Negotiations have since turned sour and now Kojima seeks pure Revengeance against his soon-to-be former employers. “They played me like a damn fiddle!” Kojima lamented, striking his fist against the side of his personal Hind D helicopter. “I’ll make them pay for this…I wield a weapon that will surpass Metal Gear.”

When asked about the reason for his departure, Kojima explained that with all of his experience as a game developer, series director and nano-machine researcher, it became apparent that Konami has been using his projects to drive the world towards nuclear annihilation.

“After all of my research into the Les Enfants Terribles project — after developing the perfect spy soldier — Konami finally sees fit to be rid of me,” Kojima continued. “I’ve given so much of my life to this foxhound… Game development has changed. It’s an endless series of proxy coding, created by teenagers with engines.” Kojima then donned an eye patch and hid within a cardboard box he’d stored beneath his desk. Upon his exit, he stated, “I’m not a tool of Konami anymore…”

[9/2/2015 6:39:34 AM] Logan.: That feeling when you first start Skyrim. Everything is new, everything is an adventure, everything is exhilarating and terrifying. You are fumbling with strange elixirs and powerful weapons, but you are also met by fearsome enemies. This province's past, present, and future are unfolding before you and it festers on top of your head. The inhospitable tundra is gradually assuming you, and you begin to feel at home among the spruce and the snow. This province is molding you into a new person, while you mold this place into a new province. There are the moments of bliss before the glowing fungi and the vibrant night sky, and it undoes all the punishment this land has brought to you, for a time at least. You have many houses, many friends, and a thousand people who know your name, but all you desire is to return to your true home, where your only friends are the hanging stars above the frigid night. Is this forever lost in familiarity, or can it be reclaimed?

[9/3/2015 3:21:03 AM] Logan.: An Internet meme (/ˈmi:m/ MEEM) is an activity, concept, catchphrase or piece of media which spreads, often as mimicry, from person to person via the Internet.[1] Some notable examples include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called "planking") and uploading a short video of people dancing to the Harlem Shake. 

A meme is "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture".[2] An Internet meme may take the form of an image, hyperlink, video, picture, website, or hashtag. It may be just a word or phrase, including an intentional misspelling. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources. They may relate to various existing Internet cultures or subcultures, often created or spread on various websites, or by Usenet boards and other such early-internet communications facilities. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet, because the instant communication facilitates word-of-mouth transmission. 

The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, as an attempt to explain the way cultural information spreads;[3] Internet memes are a subset of this general meme concept specific to the culture and environment of the Internet. In 2013 Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity—distinguished from biological genes and Dawkins' pre-Internet concept of a meme which involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate replication as in Darwinian selection.[4] Dawkins explained that Internet memes are thus a "hijacking of the original idea," the very idea of a meme having mutated and evolved in this new direction.[5] Further, Internet memes carry an additional property that ordinary memes do not—Internet memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for example, social networks) that renders them traceable and analyzable.[6] 

Internet memes are a subset that Susan Blackmore called temes—memes which live in technological artifacts instead of the human mind.[7] 

Image macros are often confused with internet memes and are often miscited as such, usually by their creators. However there is a key distinction between the two. Primarily this distinction lies within the subjects's recognizability in internet pop-culture. While such an image may display an existing meme, or in fact a macro itself may even eventually become a meme, it does not qualify as one until it reaches approximately the same level of mass recognition as required for a person to be considered a celebrity.

Of course, everything that isn't on there any more is now available completely freely in MP3 and FLAC. More info in the video!

Peep the cleanliness on the bandcamp page, or alternatively, just get straight to raiding the free music archives! I opted for a pro account on MediaFire to save you the trouble of dealing with captchas and all that.
